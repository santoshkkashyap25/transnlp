measure trees in head heights being  head its new metric were calling it just stick your head right next to the tree stump and then on the tree stump charles i charles i was a king of england he was what we call a dickhead king  that punch line comes from very rarely used in standup comedy today charles i claimed the kingships of england scotland wales and ireland and he said he was appointed by god we cut his head off nothing happened so apparently not if he had been appointed by god his execution would have sounded like this faboing faboing fabing fabing faboing faboing hang on think hes appointed by god lads it was a time when people had all that long hair he started that he put a king charles spaniel on his head look and you could see all the courtiers oh what a wonderful idea my king your hair can hear yes it has long flappy ear things shall i throw it a coughdrop there we go oh quick get a poodle get a poodle l have a poodle on my head see i have a poodle damn he has better hair than me l have a pekingese sir l have a dachshund its a bit of a throw ive got a st bernard on my head its not really worked out he caused i am making light of king charles i and his execution but he did cause up to  people to die in the bloodiest wars that we had ever had there was not one english civil war there were two english civil wars it was him and cromwell that time and cromwells coming in cromwell was saying one person one vote well okay one man one vote well one man with cash one vote he was solid with his ideas so charlie one was not appointed by god i think we can theres an outside chance that he was appointed by god but if and only if on the day of his execution and his demise god was up in heaven going delete delete delete delete love charlie one xoxoxo send shit whats the password jesus whats the password i cant remember dad i cant i dont know youre the one that knows all this technical stuff thats why i keep you around i dont i cant remember dad i had such a blinding night last night i cant remember jesus christ thats where it started it must have started there yeah the first father to say jesus christ through clenched teeth jesus christ oh whats the time

its really good you can use them on the toilet theyre great but this was  right and this is  years after the magna carta the signing of the magna carta  just before lunchtime which was when the beginnings of democracy coming back to europe after the greeks and the romans had had a go bad king john was forced by the barons of england to sign the magna carta which is latin for big card if you hadnt thought about it sign the big card we cant call it a big card magna carta much better dear barons of england if you dont know bad king john was bad because he was a crap king as well but he just smelt of sandwiches and was poor at kicking the ball into the goal hed get to the goal and go and it would go that way which is probably most of us just me then okay i have this problem i get up to i was good in the middle you know whats it called midfield and no its years  i was  when i last played a big game of football anyway so i was good and i would get up there get the ball and the ball id be so keen in front get it in the kick it just kick it does anyone else have this one just kick it pang you fucking idiot izzard so i didnt id just assist you do it you nut it in king john going have you finished i was doing the magna carta im sorry i was just reminiscing yeah well im signing the bloody thing here explain about me yes i was yes so this is bad king john barons of england have a go what are you the referee and play ball dear barons of england im terribly sorry i missed all your birthdays and you promise to hand over some of your power in the beginnings of democracy and i promise to hand over some of my power in the beginning of democracy and you always play the bad guy in the robin hood movies oh for fucks sake whos going to play good guy sean connery play good guy yes as you can hear hes in tonight',\n",
       "  ' sean connery played in robin hood prince of thieves richard the lionheart my god we had a king called richard the lionheart the greatest i think one of the greatest english kings thats ever been going great in battle theres a statue of him outside the houses of parliament born in oxford fought all the fights fought against saladin in the third crusades goodlooking played the banjo good at football the david beckham of kings right revered by the english as english as english pie and he spoke french in interviews youre king richard the lionheart oui hello i very much excitement im very pleased good morning are you king of england oh yes oui i am hello good morning bonjour i england i like it very much i like you people you are crazy and you live there no i live in france why do you live in france oh lovely weather and the wine you know but youre good at fighting im a very good fighter i could kill you i could kill that guy i could kill that rat you know i just kill them very quickly did you like the battle today very good battle i thought i thought we were good in the second half i felt you came in saladin very good manager of his team theyre muslims they fought very well you know i have a lot of respect for him we shook hands at the end of the game and maybe we should make peace you know because were both abrahamic faiths its a bit insane to murder each other but hopefully these wars will sort of tail off within about two or three years or if not a thousand years or if not theyll just keep going and then well blow up do you know some english songs oh sure sur le pont davignon heres one maybe its because im an oxforder thats true that is he spoke hardly any english and  years we had those kings but this is richard the lionheart what a name to get because we had kings like edward the confessor i think that was me sorry about that ethelred the unready what now steve the stupid i dont know kenny the collapsible i could fit in a bag and roger the rotund ive eaten a pig there are lions not even called lionheart there are lions called i am just called lenny lenin like the like the russian guy no lenny lenny lenny the lion i thought lenin the lion that would be quite fun whats your name im steve theres quite a lot of steves in this show yes yes he doesnt like thinking up new names lenny is quite unusual its actually lenin ive just changed it to lenin actually oh its quite a mobile show yes yes im ive got a lions heart ive got a ducks heart oh and for why i swapped it with a duck in a poker game any disadvantages many but im good at bobbing for apples you didnt even know you were going to say that did you no i didnt i was going to say something else and it did tumble from my mouth you realise we both have the same accent oh yes thats not good thats not good at all no it isnt now this is interesting richard the lionheart was a king during the  years from william the conqueror to henry v when in england we had the frenchspeaking kings right so french was the kingly language french was the judiciary language and the bishops language you know the religious language and everyone was writing it down and saying how it should be spelt anglosaxon english was free it was like a slang language noone was writing anything down we were the lifters and carriers going would you like another sausage all right heres another sausage for frenchy here all right come on then more sausages they love their sausages and in that time in those  years we got rid of the masculine and feminine of the words someone in that  years said hey guys guys see this spoon from now on lets call it a spoon but is it a masculine or a feminine spoon a fucking spoon steve just get a grip man well surely it must be a neutered one its just a fucking spoon but if the spoon owns a dog would it be the dog of the spoon if the spoon is sent away on an errand would it be going to the place or away from the spoon of the spoon its a fucking spoon but how will we know on the just put words around it to tell us which way the spoon is going and what if theres more than one then we put an s on the end spoons thats when it happened no one knows who did it somewhere in there they just said its just a spoon come on get a grip and thats why its taken over its no longer our language i would say we have given it to the world it is the language of shakespeare yes but its the language of rock n roll the language of hollywood the language of australia and english is no longer an invasionary language thats very interesting isnt it we used to invade with it we used to go and say hello weve come with guns and flags i see you havent got any of these what wed really like is your raw materials how about that i assume you are saying yes help yourself were just going to dig all this out of the ground yes raw minerals very good yes on a wheelbarrow now stand back please or ill hit you with a shovel all right there we go now goodbye well see you every five seconds for the rest of time romans you know they used latin as an invasionary language caesar was going round going we take over all of this france and now we go to britannia okay hello britannia we got the big hats and the big gear and what you got we got stones and v signs these are not very good okay were going to take over your place thats what were going to do you have two choices here you join us or you die multiple choice i like that d no no no no its two choices you join us or you die oh i dont want to die well then you join us id rather not then you die i dont want to die youve got to choose one or the other switzerland why do you say switzerland there is no switzerland i dont know what you mean just okay tell me what improvements you will make in our town if you come in okay we take your town you see al',\n",
       "  'l these houses here these little mud huts and stuff and then well flatten them and well put a great big aqueduct through and then there will be a lot of water coming into your town and then going straight out to the next town and youll have no water but it will drip down trickledown effect trickle down water water everywhere not a drop to drink okay so basically youre fascist plumbers are you yes but i like the buddhists the buddhists they believe in the real guy its a philosophy not a religion they believe in geoff buddha real bloke and you cant tell whether he is a big lad or a trim lad because in india all the buddhas are trim jims yeah and all the chinese buddhas are big lads so i assume he started in india going i have many ideas we must head towards enlightenment and being awake and awakening head to nirvana and see their gigs and then come back okay this is what it is a new way control your ego these are very i like this food as well its really good another two naans please and one grandmother thank you come let us go to china bring this food well how much of it all of it so thats what happened so if you want to become a buddhist monk you can do it anyone can do it you go from unenlightened huh to first level of enlightenment oh then red belt green belt brown belt black belt ow for fucks sake then you become a buddhist monk and you shave your head and youll look like yul brynner and youll wear orange which is a difficult colour to wear but everyone in holland wears it and hardline protestants in northern ireland its the axis of bizarreness its a wifeswapping programme just waiting to happen and then you are a buddhist monk youre enlightened you are achieving nirvana and live in a monastery high on the mountains and you have a big gong and you hit it and all the other buddhists come running in is it lunch no i just hit the gong well what does it signify every time i hit a gong a buddhist monk gets his wings that was another film i dont know what hes on about but they control their ego and it doesnt help us against the fascists they go round flamethrowing murdering with guns and if a buddhist monk wishes to complain against extremists he sets fire to himself i think the nazis just go well thats what we were going to do so thanks for saving us the petrol so its okay to have an ego thats what i think you know most of us have egos president lincoln in  in america said the better angels of our nature were trying to get our egos to dovetail i think thats what it is and as a performer you need to have an ego i need to bound on stage and say three men went into a pub englishman irishman scotsman welshman chinese man venezuelan man burgundian crossbowman two kippers a banana and a helicopter went into a pub and the landlord said what the fucks going on its an izzard joke i dont know im not serving the helicopter you bastard all right forget that now you know these arenas i have played a fair few arenas in my time and wembley was one of the first ones i played in london wembley arena and i remember i played it about  times and i went there recently to watch jesus christ superstar a musical yeah and i went to watch that and wembley arena and afterwards i get in a taxi back in  minutes out of the centre and taxidriver asian british taxidriver said where would you like to go i would like to go back to piccadilly please no problem and how will we get there my good man in my car i have a car attached to the steering wheel you see do you not understand the principles of mime so we drive off into town and were chatting away and when we get to piccadilly he says right now will you be going back to wembley and i thought my god my ego kicked in at this point and i thought im getting through to the asian community he knows how many times ive played wembley i went off on one and i said yes i think i will be going back to wembley thank you for the question i think i have to go back to wembley dont you i struggled so hard to get there was it traffic in some ways i think i will forever be going back to wembley therell always be a wembley and he was going well heres my card im working till  am this morning i can give you a lift back you see oh tonight no no no i dont live there what were you talking about the demons they come in my mind i what part of wales are you from im from swansea actually my mothers from swansea my father from mumbai i am an indian welsh person and my accent is somewhere in between the two dont you know boyo probably i understand cooking is very difficult would you like a steering wheel i am fine thank you ive just eaten thank you all the same so in wembley i went to see jesus christ superstar and its a musical and i dont know musicals im an action transvestite i dont know what they are on about i know action movies i know die hard one two three four five is it now terminator one two three i know those films i put on makeup i go out and i fight things not actually but in my mind you know fuck lipsticks everywhere you know you know the problems id go watch die hard the musical yippee kiay motherfucker yippee kiay motherfucker yippee kiay im in the nakatomi towers nakatomi towers my wifes downstairs and therere some terrorists there and one of them is kind of german but probably not cause weve done that before and alan rickman does a very good american accent but musicals it seems to me they can be about anything theyve just got to be upbeat and people have got to win in the end and you just sing ive lost my trousers hes lost his trousers where can they go where have they gone walked away they walked away in the night was it a thief or were they burnt in a fire or did mice steal them put them on their heads look like big ears and run away and they felt they were dogs in the night',\n",
       "  ' oh i dont know hell have to go to trouser mountain trouser mountain go to trouser mountain yeah get a new pair of trousers hell go to trouser mountain and there anything as long as it ends upbeat and you get another bloody pair of trousers fine ive lost three legs hes lost three legs how can that be hes only got two to start with hes lost hes lost one more than is possible hes got a negative number of legs thats impossible unless hes a mathematician no hes a spider a spider he started with eight and ended up with only five using basic mathematics five legs thats okay most of us have two but hes got five so whats he crying about in his soup pull off one more hell have four thatll look pretty good no theres four down one side and one on the other and if you pull that one off hell just go over need to go to wheel mountain to get a wheel on the other side youve probably heard these musicals before they thank you for that small round of applause but it music makes you applaud you know comedy doesnt comedy you just go okay fuck it whereas music could be ive lost cheese down my trousers my monkeys made of spam my brother lives in a helicopter and he eats out of a can ive got no knees ive got no cheese ive got no monkeys except in a breeze and when things go as long as it vaguely rhymes cheese comes up then sellotape your head to the back of a chair i havent finished yet and then well die it was a bit of a weird last line wasnt it thats not in most musicals and then well die dye your hair bright green and okay lets go its not going to get better than that no i was watching jesiquesi superstary and its a religious story and yes hes in tonight and its a religious story but i think its a secular version with tim rices lyrics its almost the judas story not jesiquesi superstar but judicrusi superstar with judas going come on jesus lets get the fascists man theyre fascist plumbers they do things with the water thats illegal stop washing your hair i got to wash my hair man why i cant remember any wifi passcodes and i got to wash my hair i dont know its got two in one we could give that to the poor they dont want to wash their hair cant say that youre a big twit and that bit when pontius pilate who was a pilot by the way he flew for the romans you know flew baldheaded eagles and once flew one straight through a toupee factory with obvious consequences cant fucking see man fucking hair in my eyes a hobbits going look the eagles the eagles you all right mate i couldnt see got hair in my eyes is that your hair no i got it at the toupee factory thats in the second version of lord of the rings lord of the rings the hairy eagles back to the jesiquesi the musical its about the fatherson sacrifice and human sacrifice was the other way round we used to do it if i can route all the way back to the beginning we used to kill people for gods cause gods love praise oh they do oh they do all prayers are full of praise dear god thou art amazing thou art stunning i love what you are wearing i assume because i cant see it thou did build a world thou did make it round and didnt tell anyone and the spanish inquisition it was so inquisitive hopefully you got some good information out of that that you can use in guantanamo bay for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory the cheese and the cheeseboard the fish and the fingers and then hymns are just more of the same the singing version hallelujah hallelujah praise god until your tongue explodes till your knees drop off till your eyes go wonky in your head praise and praise him and god must be up there every sunday going they love us down there louder louder louder put a backbeat in where are the gospel singers do kumbaya do you do requests jesus come on holy ghost angel gabriel so why the hell were we killing people because people have to do all the praising it doesnt make any sense its immoral its illogical and it takes a hell of a lot of cleaning up with a dyson heres the logic crops used to fail in the old days people thought the gods were in charge of anything theyd say the gods hate us we must please the gods lets do a dance for the gods logical sing a song we love you logical carve a loveheart in the sand logical bake him a cake logical but what bloody rightwing extremist said the crops have failed the gods hate us lets kill steve what the fuck was all that about these are the things that i would have argued as i was being dragged off to be sacrificed dont kill me im a praiser no im good at it im a loudmouth get the quiet people first get the librarians theyre all and it was always virgins wasnt it and so if we were all in the tribe and they were sacrificing virgins and we were virgins we would do something about it wouldnt we we would fuck each other fuck a friend and save a life boys would use it as a pickup line janine were good friends arent we have you heard of the fuckafriend programme come on janine come on janine birds do it birds do it bees do it not together thats illegal it was always the priests that were doing all the sacrificing dragging up virgins come on we must sacrifice these two virgins right now we can do it and then the gods hey stop that stop it stop damn well they were virgins then all right get a tent thank you look ive got a hundred lined up outside theyre all virgins so we can sacrifice stop it stop that bugger shouldnt have made them stand in a circle i suppose thats your joke thats your joke i didnt say anything i just gave you a mathematical symbol there was always the priest with the big hats the long dresses bone through their nose early transvestites from the dark side come on you must why must i cause you didnt do it l was up for doing it its all about timing kid no thats comedy thats true the secret of comedy and human sacr',\n",

just tell me what i did all right just be precise well you look like the devil thats why no we look like the roman god bacchus and then when constantine took the romans into christianity they were all scratchy about the god of partying and getting it on so we were demonised because we had little pointy bits coming out of our heads but elk have got an entire coat rack coming out either side of their heads and thats just fine and dandy look these are facts im a fascist i dont know about facts dont you know the three rules of fascism make shit up scream it loudly then kill people hitler came up with the jewish bolshevik conspiracy now youve heard this many times it was screamed out in nazi germany for many years its garbage from the beginning to the end the jewish people demonised cause they were supposed to be all about money and the bolsheviks were hated cause they were not into money what what the hell did they have a conspiracy about disagreeing thats just garbage just like the nazis going on its the farmer astronaut conspiracy can you not see how the farmers they plough the fields with the oxen and they lay the seeds and then the astronauts can you not see the links the dog helicopter conspiracy every time a helicopter lands dogs go they are talking to the helicopters the sock banana conspiracy they almost look the same and a banana can get inside a sock but not the other way round so many goats have died throughout the years think about the guy and his prodigal son my prodigal son has returned he has prodded everything have you finished prodding l have prodded everything father and what have you learned some people are spongy and some people you can dent your finger on well we will celebrate we will slaughter a lamb and slaughter a goat and slaughter the nextdoor neighbours its just too much slaughtering what was this most goats die badly dont they very few goats die in their beds surrounded by their families drinking a glass of stella artois like in

places only five per cent of toilets in france like that sometimes they have very cool toilets in france you know the ones with shared basins and everyones getting on very well but sometimes you could be in somewhere like montmartre centre of paris and everyones there with berets and dark glasses and smoking gitanes and drinking espresso someones stolen the toilet theres no toilet here and then you

salad very popular with chickens and exdictators we have sausage egg and chips and the enigma variations thereof and we also have spaghetti alla carbonara do i need a tray no you do not need a tray trays have been banned in this canteen eight years ago there was a fight and many people died upon the floor the day was only saved by mr stevens head of catering he did come into the fray and did pick up a tray and immediately it fell out of his hands because it was wet and he picked up another one and that one fell out of his hands because it was wet a third and a fourth fell from his hands the fifth one he staplegunned to his',\n",
       "  ' hand and then he went into action pang pang pangpang pang sometimes with the edge of it even now people sing songs about that day such as mr stevens he fought like two demons who were insane with a tray and he fought with a tray and he panged people in their face and panged them dead and panged them all around mr stevens he pangs people in the face he panged them to the left and he panged them to the right and if he ran at them straight on hed do a forward pang or hed use the edge bit and thats why we sing songs of mr stevens so i dont need a tray then i take it what do you do with the food well just pour it into your hands thats a bit bloody weird i will have the spaghetti alla carbonara no thats saved for lord vader do you know who i am not another bloody game of who the

sorry i just got carried away ill share my spaghetti alla carbonara with you okay okay okay ill have sausage egg and chips yes ill have some of your chips its a bit of a saga now i was watching a documentary the other day called clash of the titans right they were all there all those great titans there was diana the god of hunting roger the god of baked potatoes minerva the god of wisdom and siobhan the god of dangerous spelling for the god siobhan said i will start with the letter s and i will go through the entire scrabble board before i get to the letter n and that will fuck up dyslexics around the world who think my name is spelt like shivaughn when in fact i am siobhan and another titan was there that was zeus playing the role of the god liam neeson liam neeson is a kind of god all the way from ballymena in northern ireland he has conquered hollywood and he is quite often in quite mainstream films now like battleship where everyones going lets put pigs in a bag before the metal people come out of the water and pee on our heads he is holding onto logic i think hes hired to hold onto the centre of the film ive got the centre of the film lads ill just hold onto sensible stuff here in the film the people on earth are just behaving badly and zeus is up there going what the hells going on down there this is very early liam neeson impression i am doing okay when he was still about  back in ballymena you tell them theyd better buck their ideas up otherwise i will release the kraken so i will now if you dont know about the kraken the kraken is a huge turtle in the film and it is as angry as you can believe you know turtles normally are kind of and when turtles get angry they look kind of but this one is kind of crazy so halfway through the film zeus is as good as his word and he says right release the kraken and tell the kraken to get down there get down there to lesbos besbos whizbos and gizbos right find the ringleaders set fire to their houses burn their boats and pee on their relatives and remove their underwear and throw it in the hedges and just generally rubbish them in the local amateur dramatic press so the kraken is released from under the water he comes out with no plan look at his eyes no plan its a george w bush kraken then he stamps on things basic rightwing foreign policy probably for two or three weeks probably about week four and week five probably about week  hes got bored and hes moved to mexico and hes hanging out with a lot of vietnam veterans playing poker hes all right the kraken he can play the ukulele oh mr stevens but in the film they said and mr zeus mr liam neeson said release the kraken but at no point did he ever go retrieve the kraken the krakens still out there still wandering around greece going ive no idea what im doing any more no im not very good on financial matters terribly sorry im just a kraken really i stamp on things thats what i do sorry i think youre supposed to pay some taxes at some point not really sure look good luck on getting it all together again but you know come on you got to try to make this thing work otherwise its going to be hell to pay when izzard goes stamping around but they did have a great idea back in the old days the idea of having a healthy mind and a healthy body i remember reading this its a greek idea mens sana in corpore sano thats the latin for the greek idea i think and the idea that this and this both worked i couldnt work that surely this works and this is or this works and this is tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet thats what i thought you know remember when we were kids this was good wasnt it come on run run why are we running there could be icecreams over there but in our heads it was like those early computer games wasnt it nothing much going on now our minds are sharp we can multitask we can sit on our toilets and use an ipad at the same time go poos and send an email but our bodies our bodies are like two weasels covered in gravy and nailed to the back of a tractor and you know that ive done a little bit of running about cause i was trying to get this bit working with this bit you know i was trying to head back to this ancient greek olympic idea and remember thi',\n",

that were we i dont know if you remember just before the olympics there was that thing that happened in britain maybe its a british thing maybe its a human thing but we suddenly went into this is going to be really expensive and all the people are going to come and oh my god theyll all speak different languages and well have to talk loudly to them but then we started winning left right and centre upside down well everybody was going crazy and all those sports anyone can do and that was one of the great except for one or two theres one or two that are still kind of posh rowing you got to go to a school thats got a river you cant do it and be in an innercity school sitting in your bath going i was pretty good in the bath the waters got to be on the outside of the bath oh on the outside i got it all back to front and horseriding you need a bloody horse right and the horses are in tonight so you need to have a horse you cant live in an innercity school and say i found a great dane in a skip and he only had front legs but he used to drag himself round game boy he was you need horses you need many horses and it cuts down into jumping over things and the dressage the jumping over things based on ancient hunting techniques of running and jumping and dressage based on fuck knows what ancient dressage its a french word dressage translated into english it means dressage where does it come from maybe the surrealist wars maybe at a time when people said you men and you women get on your horses ride towards the enemy feint right cut left duck down go along like this come up do this eyes and teeth eyes and teeth sing mr stevens go to trouser mountain what is going on because who watches it you must admit you dont go whens the dressage on whens it on it just comes up on the screen and you go oh and when it comes on you go has it been on an hour a year have they finished is he a spider just the horses doing things you think these people are on crack whats going on i salute them though i salute because they got us medals and they trained hard but why cause they can do things that are of no use ever in life unless you wish to park your horse in a cupboard hes going up to the cupboard now app',\n",
       "  'roaching the cupboard now here comes lucky jim ridden by lady jane trains its got one door open of the cupboard hes going to get the horse in the cupboard its a very difficult manoeuvre hes got the second door is open of the cupboard hes in hes backed into the cupboard there its a very good move there drawers open hes stepping into the drawers hes closing the drawers pulling that one door shut pulling another door shut its the first horse in a cupboard for  years four points scorers give four points and for an extra point can you see narnia i think so through the back of the thing extra point for narnia there we go and its just a little bit weird if people walk up to you you tend to think theyre standard people but if you saw anyone coming up to you like this youd go what the hell is this guy doing they just look a bit theyre training horses to look like burglars you know and theres nothing to burgle is there they should build a structure then the viewing figures would go up through the roof here comes lucky jim hes coming up to the building now its been specially built for the occasion has three rooms inside one has a safe with the jewels inside lucky jim came got the bronze medal in helsinki and got the silver medal in timbuktu and now here he comes once he gets in and breaks into the structure the clock starts four minutes to get out the clock has started the window is open there he is hes into the kitchen hes going round the kitchen opening the drawers of the kitchen the horse is opening the lower drawers the riders opening the upper drawers going up there turning on all the taps i dont know what hes doing there hes spun round thats very good going into the bedroom going round there looking under the bed theyve sat down on the bed thats quite good thats quite fun hes going for a cupboard hes going for a cupboard one two three four hes into the drawers hes locked the cupboard four falls and a submission hes coming back round hes coming back out of the thing hes into the lounge still hasnt found the safe behind the picture behind the pelmet i dont know hes looking at things going in the drawers coming over its there hes found the safe opening with hooves now hes using his hooves opening the safe can he open the thing with his hooves its open hes got jewellery round the neck earrings on hes got the valuables now hes coming out he has to get back down here to retrace his steps he does a spin comes back up out of the thing windows open hes coming out of the thing hes going wed watch that wouldnt we oh yes and its the only animal that does dressage there are no others theres no dog dressage dogs are at those dog shows and they get taken round on a lead and they just do this this is all i can do this is all i can do go round in circles cat dressage would be impossible this room is big enough yak dressage big lads are yaks theyre not very active in the dressage department yak dressage is pretty similar to british tai chi and think of genghis khan he knew about horses all right my men i have trained you to ride on horses fight on horses eat sleep and breathe on horses you will are you sean connery im a little bit like him just dont touch lad im using my gorky park the hunt for red october no its not siberian where am i mongolian slightly more mongolian i think youre just sean connery arent you shut your face we will ride on our horses across the plains of mongolia to the steppes of russia down the steppes of russia into the basement of russia and back up the escalator of russia and on into the pages of wikipedia will you ride with me will you ride i genghis khan will lead you benghis will you come yes genghis denghis all right genghis thengis how are you naming us using the tolkien method of alliteration siobhan are you coming put the scrabble set away if you will love steve will you ride with us i will i wont be coming this time actually i wont be coming this time actually genghis cause i bought this horse and hes a little bit weird i bought him with some magic beans and he just does things which are not useful but ive parked in the cupboard three times good thing is if you roll him over and make him breathe out you can dry your hands in his mouth thats quite fun it is a true thing dressage was true they used to ride into battle with the big iances and then get into the melee of people and its all blood and guts and all horrible and then the people try and kill the horses and then they use dressage to get out said get out dressage dressage and the horses would get out theyd say why didnt you kill the horse i didnt know what he was doing i thought it was halftime entertainment its like ballet you see sometimes they call it horse ballet and ballet is again who watches ballet it must be people who do dressage they just watch each other and go oh yours is similar to ours you know and ballet is straight women and gay men doing amazing stuff noone getting hurt and noone having sex and women wear tutus and the men wear stuff that even i as a transvestite would say really are you sure its always best to leave something to your imagination before the imagination explodes so the olympics tells us what we can do with a healthy body but with a healthy mind maybe we can gain wisdom yes and for wisdom in the old days we had pipes everyone had pipes didnt they you stick a pipe in your mouth suddenly you were wise a bit weird you didnt have to be wise you just stuck it in and went thats a very good point i see what youre saying no i didnt think of it that way look at the stars isnt that amazing look wheres orion gone look at his belt no one said silly things with a pipe in their mouth no one said im going to put my dick in this toaster now so wise things were said by pipe smokers but not any more yea',\n",
       "  'h you wouldnt ask pipe smokers opinion now you wouldnt say whats going on in this town hells going on in this town what shall we do maybe we should talk to those people who all smoke pipes and live in that one house bingbong yeah there are terrible things we have no salad the cucumbers are gone and the radishes the balsamic vinegar its almost gone what do we do find the people sellotape their legs together put their eyeballs in the different sockets rearrange their tongues count their toes and put them on the numbers backwards would you like some crack do people who smoke crack ever go maybe this is the crack talking but i think we should all nail our foreskins to that rocket what do you say bad idea then there was lord of the rings lord of the rings a big pipe smoking film that starts in the misty mountains where a hobbit goes what is this a golden ring should i put it on and marry someone or put it on become invisible and take over the world two obvious logical choices i dont know what to do what does it say one ring to rule them one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and have a big party and nail some of their toes together while smoking crack what thats weird who is that in the darkness my precious who who are you and talking about precious it is me lady smeagol i am lady of the misty mountains these are my caves ive lost my precious is your precious a small band of gold no its a chicken called tony with electronic legs tony where have you been youve been down the goblin market oh have you youve got some candles and some throw cushions you can

ive come to the misty mountains to find my density or destiny or i brought a humidifier a humidifier in the misty mountains that will just make it the very misty mountains should i have bought a dehumidifier that would just make it the mountains then sauron was on the rise again and saruman two people who sound to a dyslexic kid like the same person and the nasdaq is on the rise then the nasdaqs on the fall the nasdaq rises and falls stocks and shares going crazy and the fellowship of the ring ran to rivendell where gandalf says someone must take the ring of power and they must take it to mordor which has nine rs in it someone must take it i do not know who i cannot take it cause i am tall immensely powerful and cannot die why didnt he volunteer why did he never i have no idea who could take it maybe some small twit could i will take it i will take it i frodo will take it all the way to mordor but i am but half a man i do not know the way i am a dwarf i am twothirds of a man i will help the half a man then we will be a total of oh shit about one and a bit men yes but what precisely aragorn i dont know you i dont know im just here with this rocket i didnt know we had a rocket programme its six isnt it its one half of a man plus two thirds then well be its six we will be seven sixths yes yes yes aragorn will you join us i aragorn will join you and then i am a man i am one and one ratio to men so six six well be  sixths this is a bloody complicated scene this is legolas are you coming i am fourfifths of a man maybe i should stay here no come lad come then well be thirtieths its thirtieths thats  divided  thirtieths thats a bloody army that is thats just three men you realise that its three men oh bloody hell what do you think zeus well since elrond has left i zeus have taken over this place so i have and i am running the whole of legoland here you people need a plan so i think i should hand over now to my military advisor who will advise you how to take this thing to mordor all right all right i understand basically were using the battle of austerlitz napoleons plan to use the pratzen heights will be mount doom thats how its going to work please explain more head of military intelligence lady smeagol absolutely i will do this we will be going and youre the fellowship of the ring aragorn and frodo and gimli and legolas and bagpuss all five of you will go on with the help of the kraken hello everybody how are you doing hes our orcstamper general and will be leading the diversion away from the big mountain there and then weve got the two moles who are going to tunnel their way in hello their names are pinky and perky this is going to be bloody difficult when i do this show in french ill have to do a scottish accent in french for fucks sake then they went off they went off towards mordor through cats and dogs and orcs and fish with fingers and they get to mount doom and they rerelease the kraken good luck everyone stamping on orcs and the moles said come on dig use the map its no good they get into the centre of mount doom the toilet without a toilet and then throw the ring in you must throw the ring in my love no you cant keep it you will become a powerful chicken you will become immensely powerful and like cate blanchett in that film do you not love me throw the ring in and then we can be together this is no good who will beat some sense into this crazy chicken mr stevens head of catering i didnt expect you i came arunning with my tray im here you bloody chicken pang pang pang do you understand now throw it in my love and the ring fell down down into eternity and the chicken lost all the power in the world and the ability to tell everyone to be quiet when he was doing the last bit of the show and the ability no no

appreciate the assumption you dont know me dominos plumph this giant taco tastes like italy im trying to be more tolerant you know im trying theres too many everybodys got their own thing going on its a waste of time to not be openminded at a lot of these things im trying to be tolerant but its difficult the tolerance its tested routinely i was on a flight going from denver to chicago and halfway through my flight midair  feet the guy sitting next to me starts eating pancakes out of a bag not like a ziploc bag with like a little seal and like a hey i meant to do this vibe like a bag from the store not a store that sold pancakes see im saying like a foot locker bag you get me theyre just loose theyre just loose in there theyre like bingo balls just loose and theres nothing wrong with what he was doing morally speaking but you gotta realize that if you do some wackadoo shit like eat pancakes out of a shoe store bag on an airplane youre forcing strangers around you into a world of questions they never anticipated they would ever have to ask first off wha how what  first off all the questions all of them first off every question why are you why how did you get to this point in your life where are you going because like there thats not how do you wind up if youre on an airplane youre on there with purpose you are fighting gravity to travel through the sky to land on another part of the earths crust nobodys like waking up casually like amelia earhart like i think ill take to the skies today you have purpose you have reason to fight nature to go somewhere else how do you have that purpose in your life but still do it with hastilypacked hobo snacks in your midst thats not how you catch a plane youre not like is this one going southbound havent seen grapefruit joe in a while drop in well share some beans thats not how you catch a plane usually getting to an airport thats your number one priority in the day i dont care what happens im gonna get to that airport you can cut ill lose a hand ill fix it when i get there just get me to the airport this guy it was number four or five on his list this guy was like i know i got a flight but it is tuesday and you know what happens on tuesday silverdollar flappies thats what happens tuesday is silverdollar flapjack day a lot of people say hey how come you make the silver dollar ones i make em that way i dont make em full size i make them smaller cause i',\n",

make them all and ill freeze them in ziploc bags and when i need them ill just have them ready what time is it shit i gotta go whats around well i did buy some new shoes the other day foot locker bag shovel shovel knot bindle boxcar airport made it and he got on the plane hes on the plane meaning we went through security he went through an xray machine his stuff went through pancakes got xrayed that day a tsa agent somebody with a badge and responsibility and if they were fulfilling even a fiber of their requirements of keeping the skies safe somebody had to at least just like mumble something like um sir im s um is this a bag of pancakes it it is ook yeah yeah its pan pancakes yeah well ive never dealt with it before either im gonna say go ahead i dont know i dont know we might get an earful for this but right now bon voyage thats what im gonna say and when you eat pancakes out of a bag in a semipublic place there are rules first off let people know what youre getting into make a little announcement hey everybody i got a bag of pancakes over here dont get freaked out offer em around dont you dont have to go front and back just same row dont worry nobodys taking any its just a gesture see they are in fact pancakes would you care for some no i understand then when you go to eat them with your hands cause my man did not have fork and knife on his person you eat them one at a time drivers ed style  and  you take a little nibble out of  and you hold it in your lap until youre ready for another bite you follow those rules go crazy hell i like your style way to usurp inflated airport pricing no i got my own good move this fucking guy he starts off hes just rustling around under there hes just rustling you cant rustle on an airplane in this day its suspicious hes rustling hes kicking up odors now we got people is that breakfast i smell breakfast youre not supposed to smell food on a domestic flight all it takes is one paranoid weirdo to be like i think hydraulic fluid smells like breakfast were going down now were all in a panic cause you dont know what hydraulic fluid smells like he gets the bag out rips it open with a confidence like yeah im eating all these bitches rips it open starts rooting around in there doing this cotton candy thing rooting around but hes not looking in the bag hes looking up and off into the distance with this look of glazed determination on his face the kind of look you only see on the faces of people that are neckdeep in swamp water cause theyre gonna catch a catfish with their bare hands you know just like we gonna get em pulls his hand out hes got two or three just in a grip in a fist hes not going discreet under the chin hes not going like hey im sorry for this under the chin hes going over the top just like  jordan layup style just haa dropping em in then looking around with an attitude after each bite like snack time motherfuckers boom jealous much are you shitting me im a delta gold member i gotta sit next to this no syrup you go straight to hell cause i dont know where youd get syrup in a situation like this probably another bag seeing as how this dude operates but even then unwritten rules of decent society state you open up that bag of syrup you pour it into your original bag of pancakes and you tie it off nice and tight and shake it around for even coverage cause you might be making a bit of mess but at least people are like well hes not gonna eat them dry like a psychopath why is this what im upset about why are these the things that anger me theres bigger problems in the world i got a blank fortune cookie thatll fuck up your whole day you dont know what it means somebody with common sense would just be like maybe the paper wasnt aligned right it didnt  not me im like thats confucius himself weighing in thats confucius his advice is i got nothing for you man you are on your own or maybe this is some jason bournetype stuff maybe this is how they let the super spies know theyre activated i dont know i watch too many movies i crack that open im like i must be activated im a super spy that means i know all kinds of martial arts and foreign languages so i start yelling in what i assume to be mandarin it seems appropriate given my surroundings becomes very apparent right away all i know is remedial spanish which at least they understand it because im having this outburst at a panda express in east la some guy behind the counter like whats wrong with white boy why does he keep yelling about where the library is meanwhile im just making a mess like donde esta la biblioteca krav maga bang kicking over lunches then i just go to apologize buy combo b platters for everybody lo siento lo siento no soy jason bourne lo siento the worst are like the thoughts that

horrible person you know you drive by a forest preserve or a nice park on your way to work nine times out of ten youre like man thats a nice one of these days im gonna have a picnic in that forest it was nice that they set that land aside im gonna have a picnic maybe im gonna fly one of those fancy kites that people learn how to maybe thatll be my hobby nice kites the fancy ornate ones and then theres that one time like man if i have to hide a body thats the park i would do it in thats the best place yeah man chop it up spread it out make sure to get rid of those fingers and the teeth cause how they find them i watch csi a whole bunch youre like why are you thinking about hiding a body well i dont know maybe i would have to kill somebody why would you have to kill somebody well what if somebody hurt my family now youre just making a list of justifiable murders and then thats on your way to your work and you dont like your job so much and nine times out of ten now youre like thats where i hide bodies maybe one of these days when im done hiding these bodies ill learn how to fly that fancy kite ive been talking about i dont like those thoughts i dont like em its just bink you thought this you son of a bitch i was in louisville kentucky i hadnt been there before just walking around trying to get some lunch looking for lunch in all the wrong places walking around i saw it was it was two black guys and one of them was holding a white baby i was like they stole that baby i didnt want its not like i put it together it was like bink thats what you thought you son of a bitch and the irony was i was on my phone trying to find out if a particular sandwich chain had donated to antigay charities cause im like i cannot support that that is hatred and i will not eat there ill make my own sandwich ill go buy bread and meat if i have to but i will not support that kind of hatred those guys stole that baby but i will not go eat at this place i didnt even think that they maybe they were gay cause one of them was smoking i was like gay dads dont smoke thats not even a thing thats what i made up after the other thing that popped in there how are you gonna justify thinking that the two black guys stole the white baby why arent they just gay guys well one of thems smoking gay dads dont smoke stop making up stereotypes im disgusted with myself i went to seoul south korea last year id never been to asia i was just taking in this amazing amazing city and im just walking around bright sunny day walking around the market and just out in the sunshine and im the only one wearing sunglasses im like how come im the only one wearing sunglasses im like they dont need them cause their eyes are already dont even finish it dont even finish it why is that whats in here and its not even like a bad its like you dont need sunglasses thats kind of a nice thing thats convenient but its still bad im not any happier about this than you guys are all right im upset with myself but thats what like you see people like stereotypes exist for a reason yeah cause youre a dickhead thats why they exist thats great asians are bad drivers go to asia asians are amazing drivers theyre just punk rock about it they just dont give a shit about the rules when they come over here theres a traffic circle with  people in seoul south korea no lines no lights just whirring i saw a guy on a scooter with  chickens on the back cut off a bus he didnt lose the ash off his cigarette that guy comes over here youre like youre not using your signal hes like screw you ive driven over bombedout bridges i can handle a merge but redefine that if youre asian put nascar bumper stickers all over the back of your car and just blow some hillbillys mind that wants to believe like course hes a crummy driver hes an asian hold on a second here what wait no this guys clearly a fan of the sport no i think this guy knows exactly whats hes this is some kind of new drafting technique we gotta watch this guy call up dale call up dale tell him the asians are on him now you know theres a stereotype that black people like to talk in movie theaters theres a stereotype that white people are uptight kind of proved that one when i said that thing about black people and nobody knew if they could laugh or not if youre black and youre here please do this sit next to the most uptight white person you can find in the movie theater not tough to do like single guys at the movies the worst see those guys who are like no you sit two down you sit three down no gay buffer gay buffer yeah good good thing you did that cause i was totally waiting for transformers  to fuck you now i cant cause of the seats now i cant blow you during transformers  because of your elaborate scheme sit right next to that dude and watch him already ',\n",
       "  'like well theres plenty i put those seats here for a reason and then say something during the movie but say something thats gonna blow the white dudes mind thats how you twist it you like you wait until like the action gets right at the at the pinnacle then you just blurt something out like this reminds me of woody allens earlier work and hes just like thats exactly what i was thinking you know really let him have it this lighting is reminiscent of kurosawas can we go to the movies all the time i think between that and a quality spicy mayonnaise were not gonna solve racism but were gonna shave some of the sharp edges off of it spicy mayonnaise spicy mayonnaise youre the same idiot upset about pho of course youd understand why spicy mayonnaise will unite the races youre whiter than i am all right pull it together thanks for being here it was free whatd you say your friends even shut you up there all right i had one flight i was going crosscountry la to new york and i bought a ticket on orbitz and i got a direct flight on orbitz and thats not supposed to happen no no orbitz its a good website but wed would be like hey orbitz i wanna go from here to that stool and orbitz would be like no problem man you just gotta go to denver five times first and i like saving  so im like all right go broncos or whatever lets see what lets see whats going on in denver i dont know cause im gonna save  so i get it and i get it and im excited but im suspicious at the same time cause thats not how its supposed to work and i cant just have nice things cause i was raised catholic so everything has some kind of guilt price tag attached to it like somethings working out something bad has to happen whats it gonna be like you just cant have that youre catholic two sunny days in a row yeah but your friends gonna die why why cant things just be nice why cant i just like something and because its nice so i get to the airport i got a lot of trepidation at the airport im thinking maybe the airplanes gonna be messed up like its gonna have like one jet engine one propeller engine some kind of johnny cash onepieceatatime assembled aircraft so im inspecting it with all aeronautical knowledge ive accrued being a comedian so im like in the gate looking at it im looking under it from the gate like yeah it looks like its all right looks looks safe im telling people like it looks safe they dont care i get to board first its like all right well how about this i get you know i get an aisle seat are you kidding me i get to stretch the ponies out the whole time maybe things are just looking up the planes boarding im sitting there everybody else is coming on along come the people thatll be sitting next to me in my row theyre two chubby spaniards a couple spaniards they were white but speaking spanish they werent like conquistadors they werent looking for gold wearing armor they were just white and speaking spanish you dont know how to comprehend that spaniard is a fun word to say the hell with it were calling them spaniards and they take their seats all right and away we go plane taxiing takes off in the ascent of the airplane the spaniards wasting no time that armrest goes up and they start trying to fuck just right there seats a and b seat c kyle kinane a and b fucking twothirds fucking onethird kyle kinane not invited to the party and im upset about that and in their defense they werent like there wasnt just naked butts in the air they had pulled a big coat up over them but you know whats happening under there theres movements theyre not playing cards under there all right its not like im just gonna hear uno you know thats not how it works i guess i would probably hear one i dont know how it works with the translation a little wordplay for you but so im upset right away im like no this is unacceptable and i do not like this and im upset i can see my flight attendant shes still strapping were taking off were not even in a place where the flight attendant can even walk around and im like ive got my speech prepared for her im like you when we get up there and you get over here and you cause this is not appropriate behavior for air travel but exact whats she gonna say i know exactly shes gonna come over and be like did you get your ticket on orbitz im gonna be like son of a bitch  of savings right there  and so i gotta sit there and deal with my emotions im forced to deal with this situation why am i upset about this i started to get a little bit easier with it because i got flattered for a second because thats premeditated behavior thats you know that youre gonna do that you dont just like start on a plane like taking off like you feel like having a screw yeah all right good good good here we go you know youre at least at the gate making the eyes like you know you know you know we go up and then we get down so that means they walked on the plane with that knowledge already meaning they had to go by me and put a judgment on me they had to ',\n",
       "  'walk by and silently be like i bet hes cool with it so that got me that flattered me im like im a cool guy i am a cool guy i dont want you to think im not a cool guy i dont know maybe they got a bucket list number  you know screw on a crosscountry flight i dont know but i just realized that im not on this earth to be a goalie im not here to stop somebody from accomplishing their goals if youre not hurting anybody im here to either assist or get out of the way thats really all it is thats really how it should be theyre not hurting anybody theyre doing the opposite very aggressively but theyre doing the opposite so ive realized like listen like listen im gonna put my own theories to the test im gonna let them do what they need to do im gonna be a cool guy about this but because im gonna let them do what they have to do im gonna do what i have to do which in this situation is get wildly drunk and watch the shit out of this not like an oldtime spy you know like newspaper and fedora no tray table down elbow posted up like im watching a chess match so i was like ooh youre gonna move the rook what ooh bobby fischers back in town finally the flight attendant comes by and she looks over like looks at me cause its clear whats going on and i was just like cest la vie or whatever dumb thing i said to her and so i was getting my drinks and so i ordered em two at a time and just bang bang look at that over there thats a good move i like that one bang bang how did you now thats just i dont even well good for you and eventually theyre not coming fast enough the drinks the spaniards are doing fine theyre doing theyre european theyre a passionate people theyre okay so eventually i decide im going to procure my own beverages this process starts with a blanket statement i make to the entire cabin of im gonna go to the bar now if you wanna know how you can tell if youve been overserved on an airplane start with a blanket statement to everyone and in that statement include a part of the aircraft that doesnt exist the bar i may as well have been like im gonna take a dip in the hot tub like it made just as much sense i get up i address the people sitting across the aisle from me who ive never spoken to before but now its like were old bar buddies how we doing jimmy we need a topper todd you good on that theyre asleep they dont even know i bumper bowl myself back to the bar which is just the emergency exit and a cupboard and i find my flight attendant and i ask for two more drinks and she she obliges initially and she goes in there and shes tinkering around but for some reason she came back out with the drink but she had this change of heart from that moment to here because she came like like just then she realized i pulled an aha video down the whole aisle just slamming into stuff cause she brings the drinks out but shes not presenting them to me shes got them locked back here and she looks at me with this look of concern and she leans in and like does that whisper like she doesnt want to embarrass me by what shes about to say and she just says are you driving and i know she meant eventually but when the world gives you a little gift like that you dont let it go to waste so i put my hands around her hands on the drinks and then i leaned in even closer and i was like i hope not i think we might be on an airplane and it was a little one of these like whos joking around with who and then i got em and it was like yeah wink point keep it cool hot stuff whatever i said and i get back to my seat with my little trophies there and the spaniards theyre just theyre sitting there like i dont know if they got busted or they finished or what but they think they were like smooth about it they had no idea that the trois in the menage a trois we were havings coming back third spokes rolling by so they just see this coming up with two drinks sloshing around going what you dont dismount when the coach isnt around and then sitting slam the drinks down like goddamn orbitz and they dont know what i mean by that they think im just cursing the movement of celestial bodies i want this to be an art form i want comedy to be taken as an art form i feel i put just as much heart and blood sweat and tears into this as any musician or any sculptor and i want it to be appreciated as such but then i was in a van with my friends not too long ago and i unsolicitedly just announced i said hey guys these farts are like contractions for the turd baby im gonna have later and thats why im not an artist thats why this is not getting federal funding theres not gonna be a grant to perform this in the city center for the citizens i cant believe i made it anywhere creatively though because i was raised by two loving and supportive parents and nothing squashes creativity more than unconditional love and support from a functional household if you have kids shit on their dreams a little bit not all the way but enough give em some friction you need to give em some',\n",
       "  'thing to fight against i was supposed to be a musician but i didnt get that friction i wanted to be a musician  years old just im starting a punk rock band screw you guys my moms like you can practice in the basement ill make chili dip for your friends no so we practiced in the basement i remember this songs gonna take down the whole bush regime bass player was like is your mom making that really good chili dip god damn it greg would you focus on the anarchy at hand we only got till  till we got to shut it down anarchy closes at  in the suburbs im from the suburbs i think theres some credit due to anybody that made it out of the suburbs because thats a creeping oppression that you dont realize its not a glaring clear oppression i mean you grow up in the inner city and thats bullets whizzing over your head youre like im just gonna join a gang and deal drugs and im gonna get shot right in front of my mommas house and thats how life is in the streets but theres the one guy like no im gonna be a playwright and im gonna take this story to broadway and im gonna make it im gonna get out of here and you grow up in the countryside and you just till the fields sun up till sun down and then when you die they just take your body and they put it right in the field cause its fertilizer it makes the corn grow higher so youre just like fuck it im gonna be a dancer and you move to the big city and you make it as a dancer but you grow up in the suburbs and its just like well we can drive around smoking pot talking about that philosophy class that we took at community college and you know if you keep ordering stuff at dennys they cant kick you out so as long as we as long as we get like coffee if we get like coffees or french fries we can just hang out there until like holy shit im  you know you dont you dont realize that its right there i have friends that get surprised when you tell them how many kids they have i have three i forgot about the little one im  now im  i just got my own place took a while some people my age are astronauts im just excited that i get to pee with the door open which is what i did at my old place it just made my roommate sad be like youre  you think you can close the door im like youre  and living with a guy that pees with the door open maybe you need to get your life together judge not lest how the rest of that goes i just like how you get reminded of like your own immaturity like i was using one of those accelerator hand dryers like the super highpowered ones and i realized if i put my hands just right i can make a totally wicked fart sound and right as i perfected the fart sound i remember like yeah one of my best friends from high school is a surgeon but then i was just like thats too bad hes got no time to make wicked fart sounds with the hand dryer hes got to scrub up and get right to the operating room rough life for him rough life hes missing out i dont know if i got my own place because its like im thir like thats what like it was the pressures of like societal pressures like thats what you do youre  youre a grown man you live by yourself and youre an independent man you live by yourself and you start drinking scotch instead of crappy beer and you switch back to briefs thats what you do cause youre a grown man and thats what grown men do or if i got my own place cause i realize im about to get the type of weird that i cant even have people witness on accident anymore things are about to get strange and im gonna need some solitude for that and i think its much more that its not so much like im gonna pay my bills on time and read more books its much more like twizzlers look like they fit in buttholes and i cannot have somebody walking into the laboratory when dr kyles conducting his experiments its this corkscrew shape lick em and stick em fellas find out about your bodies its  its not gay its about loving yourself its okay a lot of people think henry david thoreau went into the woods civil disobedience selfreliance no twizzlers in buttholes t in the b thats what he needed read walden real close t in the b that is stupid man hey you guys ever get so lonely you sleep on your own couch instead of in your own bed cause at least that way it feels like youre laying next to somebody looks like im the little spoon again tonight maybe throw an exgirlfriends old tshirt on a pillow not for humping just for cuddling nobodys weird here loneliness is a subjective term you know its its different for everybody i mean youre a castaway on an island theres nobody around thats lonely you know but it could also mean you lack the simple courage to be able to say hello to somebody sitting next to you on a bus thats lonely too you know for me i can define loneliness i can just hone it in as the very moment that i realized that i had forgotten i was masturbating at a motel in green bay wisconsin thats it thats the point that what i remember cause thats what happens im a comedian my dream came true a',\n",
       "  ' lot of my dream is just me in a hotel room treating myself like an animal just its not even sexual anymore its just like an aggressive shooing away of a nuisance at this point so like i come on get out of here its like im taking a broom to get raccoons off the porch like come on just yah yah i understand now why a dog can hump something but still look right at you like i understand that you see a dog its like what this feels good and youre my buddy whats why youre the one making it weird what what it was i was just like in the shower and theres a boner i was like well roll up your sleeves you know its like shoveling snow at this point you know what we do something you gotta do just deadeyed staring at a wall and i realized that on the shelf there id bought the little size of shampoo i bought dandruff shampoo on accident and i saw that and i was like i dont have dandruff and i remembered thats like the old head and shoulders jingle cause i was like i dont have dandruff and then out loud i just went exactly then i got and i had a little chuckle i had a little chuckle to myself im like thats funny if youre making jokes like this and youre in the shower youre right to go out there and pursue your dreams kyle youre on the right path youre doing this stuff in the shower youre cutting yourself up youre doing the right thing with your life anyway what else what were we doing yeah well man its good i got my own place because like instead of going to the gym like i could just stay home and cry now so thats pretty awesome you macho guys crying yet you doing any of that stuff tough guys having a good cry waylon jennings you getting one i love a good old cry its good for you do what you gotta do allow that its not good to keep that stuff do what you do pull the drapes put on a dvd of how to train your dragon let it out let it out its not good to keep all those emotions bottled up inside of you now its not great to uncork em all at the grocery store at  at night but once youve allowed yourself these triggers you dont know when that magical linda ronstadt song is gonna play and youre just in the frozen food section like were doing this here were doing this here okay whoohoohoo all right wow stouffers frozen dinner for two looks like im gonna have leftovers on that one yeah she is gone all right you ever see a tv dinner just abandoned in the beer aisle yeah thats me i did that thats my street art take that banksy i dont even have to mess up anybodys wall or nothin just left some salisbury steaks up top some coors lights i think you get the message i am im very fortunate im lucky im a comedian cause otherwise my life would just be a series of undocumented low points i dont know how you guys do it hats off to you really i mean fighting the good fight out there no i just try to like make sure i learn a lesson from whatever i get into get the lesson out of it you know like i had a very i had a very particular low point it was a few months back and i was at a  buying dinner and thats not where you get a staple if youre in the vicinity of somebody that loves you i was not i was in los angeles nobody loves anybody down there nevertheless i was there i think even sadder yet is i knew exactly what i wanted too cause i made a beeline right for that little hot dog aquarium thats on the counter in there which is its own metaphor for sadness cause all those meats theyre all rolling towards you but theyre not gaining any ground its just steamy frustration in there like you could almost hear the hot dog like i can see the horizon were gonna make it no no no no no and and amongst all the tumbling sweaty meats there was one lone cheeseburger bite left in there which if you dont know what a cheeseburger bite is ima tell you its a cheeseburger sure but its shaped like a hot dog because  whole ad campaign right now i think is just fuck it youre gonna eat it youre gonna eat it youre not gonna eat it free cheese told you youd eat it and i dont know how it came into being you know i dont know if theres some weird dr moreautype character in rd at  thats just trying to mash shitty foods into one another like hot dogs will become cheeseburgers cheeseburgers will become hot dogs or if somebody dropped an actual cheeseburger onto that perpetual motion machine and then just the sheer force of time and movement it acquired the shape of a hot dog a lot like how broken glass gets smoothed out and jewellike if the waves crash on it in the sand clearly ive thought about this far too much but im in there and im just pointing it out im excited about it and the midnight clerk at  comes over a man who should not have hope left for society he shouldnt care what anybody does this guys off hes off the grid at this point even this guy tried to give me an out even he tried to like stop what he was about to see see like the same like when a blackjack dealer sees somebody thats just wasted theyre hitting on  and even they cant take it anymore theyre ',\n",
       "  'just like just like he gave me one of those he came over but he put the question on me let it be my choice he just came over and hes like what are you doing look at what youre doing what are you doing and i just i didnt even look up from the plastic i was just like im a gambler and he didnt even realize what that meant but thats where his face just dropped he didnt even use tongs just grabbed it with his hands bun here you go i didnt eat it as much as i made it disappear like a david blaine illusion thing came at me it was just like crumbs magic hands like one fell swoop myarf debit card  shoomp shoomp chase rewards points and i had to get out to the sidewalk before i realized what like everything that just happened like i just ate the same dinner as a homeless person but i didnt even savor it i didnt even appreciate it and that was a low point that was a that was a tuesday and then wednesday i got a dui and i went to jail for the more poetic of you out there whiskey icarus finally flew a little too close to the sun and i dont know if youve ever been to jail before but when you go there its you get to sit on a little bunk bed without your shoelaces and you get to contemplate your life you get to ask say things to yourself like hey kyle remember when you thought eating that cheeseburger bite was a real low point its time to recalibrate your definition of fucking up they took your belt so you dont hurt yourself and im not trying to make light of drinking and driving i made a mistake i screwed up but understand that there are grades to that crime there are degrees to drinking and driving i got my dui in los angeles im from chicago where to get a dui in chicago we got some people you clearly will understand this you would have to drive through a playground at recess and still fail a field sobriety test i pulled over on the highway once cause even i knew i was too drunk to drive in chicago pulled over shirt open gonna take a nap keys in the ignition cause i like to listen to tunes while i slumber woke up with police flashlights shining in my face and them just saying let me see your hands and my first thing i just blurt out is like howd you guys get in my room they let me drive home said you take this room back to the house that it is a part of i got my dui in los angeles where to get a dui there you just have to look like this and be singing classic rock a little too enthusiastically at  in the morning while going five miles an hour over the speed limit but i learned my lesson dont drink and drive also learned my lesson dont get your lawyer based off of yelp reviews well darrell from burbank gave him four stars how bad could he be darrell also reviewed the coffee at a jiffy lube also four stars he doesnt want to praise too much but he wants to be encouraging i like his style i think im just gonna start believing in god again why not not out of any kind of like repent or anything im not so im just bored its just a more fun place if youre agnostic like just leave the maybe there you know it just more fun like why do trees grow so tall maybe its god is that a guy following us with a knife maybe its a chupacabra you know it just the worlds a more whimsical place if you get into that i want to believe in ghosts like thats why i get maid service i like to pretend its a real courteous poltergeist spirits are real and they made the bed that was real nice of them i believe in bigfoot i think bigfoots real but i think his whole thing is that he he fucks you while youre camping and thats why the true story never came out youre just camping your tent opens up and youre like man its bigfoot and hes just like shh nobodys gonna believe you bro take off your pants thats why bigfoot walks like that all laid back just got done fucking shit there goes bigfoot looks like he just got his dick wet yeah bigfoot thats the dumbest joke ive ever written i dont know im just im gonna be agnostic i was an atheist but man those people are just the worst theyre just as bad as everybody else atheism atheisms just like its dangerous when youre a teenager its interesting in college and after that youre just a drip that ruins parties by starting everything with you seem like an intelligent person its cool that you have i just dont trust anybody that is so positive that like so certain about something you cant prove you know either way either either side you fall on god or no god i dont trust them and i dont trust people that have confidence without alcohol i do not trust those people somebody that can dance when theyre sober is the scariest person youll ever meet those should be the first people in line for murder suspects if youre youre just at a wedding you see somebody getting really loose like man how many have you had not a drop since  dont like losing control of myself you get outta here baby eater but yeah i dont know like i had this i had i guess its an epiphany i dont know what it was i was making some ikea furniture and',\n",
       "  ' i wasnt even using the instructions so i was just like freestyling on it so that pretty much makes me a carpenter and so i started like here i am just this little bearded guy being a carpenter and jesus is just a little bearded carpenter and he just traveled the land trying to make people happy and better like i just travel the land trying to make people happy and maybe ive been a christian this whole time i just didnt even know it because you try and live in a more christlike way and thats what ive been doing this whole time but then i realized that jesus probably never called a tv stand a bitch five times and then took a nap to cheers reruns out of frustration he would have persevered where i faltered so that and some other things are why im not like jesus but i have been getting the stigmata a whole lot lately so thats been throwing me off not traditional like holes in the hands and speaking ive just been getting fat and going bald its some buddhist stigmata something i i watched this documentary you guys probably know it up here called the bridge yeah nobody ever cheers if they saw it they just for those of you that dont know its a documentary about all people

every tuesday youre like im taking off no way so i understand i just never understood the how cause they show these people its always the same kind of person just kind of disheveled dirty sweatpants shuffling up the edge a little bit of hemming and hawing and then just pfft over the side just like not even one of them wore a cape or anything its the last thing youre gonna do go out with a question mark instead of a period let your loved ones its a selfish thing youre doing give your loved ones just like a moment of like wha really i dont know you know go nice suit umbrella at the last

personal flair i will do it im gonna jump off a building but im gonna do it wearing a snorkel mask and flippers and then right next to where im gonna land i wanna have a little glass of water set up

already going down its snowing were on the highway were going to the karate dojo me and my brother in the backseat im eight my brothers  i was a green belt in karate my brother was a yellow belt so he was four years older two belts lower um which is not important but i thought i would flag it and uh were driving along the highway and suddenly my dad like swerves to the side of the highway in like a panicked move and tires are screeching people are honking really dangerous he pulls over and hes really shaken up and he goes  im so sorry children but we have to get out of the car  were like what and so we get out of the car were standing by the side of the highway in the snow my brother  years old so embarrassed hes like in his karate uniform and people are driving by theyre like is he a yellow belt cause hang on a second he looks older were gonna turn the car around check this out and so were like what is going on and my dad goes ive just seen the new moon through glass so he had seen the sliver of the new moon through the windshield and we had to pull over get out of the car and he made us bow to the moon three times we had to do this whole ritual we had to say good evening lady moon it was it was mystical hes a moon man hes deep into the moon and um i was just visiting recently uh visiting home this is my childhood home that i grew up in and theyve had it since long before i was born and im in the kitchen with my mom and dad and my dad comes up to me and goes meet me in the study at dusk im like but i i go to my mom im like what time is dusk shes like i dont know  and i go up to the study which is like its been many things over the years its been like a spare room or whatever my dads there with a glass of wine looking out the window he wanted to show me theres a family of raccoons that lives in a tree in the neighbors yard and like every night at dusk they emerge and hes got yeah a relationship with them all um so were standing waiting for the raccoons and he just really dreamily goes um do you know you were conceived in this room which so i was like oh and i dont like to shut him down when hes being vulnerable so i was like wait you remember the specific night that i was conceived and he said this phrase which truly has haunted me ever since he said he goes yes of course i remember it i remember it well this is what he said the moonlight shone in over your mothers bottom  over your i feel like youre not fully getting like i now know the position i was conceived in im horrified nobody wants to be conceived doggy style its so bleak you dont want you want to be conceived face to face eye contact at the moment of ejaculation just like we were making a choice to make a life not like ah bite the pillow its horrible its its bleak its like its changed how i see myself like how i im like im a doggystyle baby  makes a lot of sense actually explains a lot its like affected my posture im just a little more im like just a little hunched

down this winding road the moose was horizontal on the road and they drove under its belly it makes me feel insane im like what are you talking about its and so its  she does a sound effect of the sound of the belly fur of the moose gently grazing the roof of the car just like  can you imagine it makes me feel insane it makes me feel crazy and uh it makes my brother irate as well because so the last time i was visiting me and my brother were like we need to get to the bottom of this we need to find out if this is even possible so we did research and we found out the height of a toyota tercel thats the car they were driving so the height of the roof of the car we googled the largest ever recorded moose and the infuriating thing is it could just have happened it could just have happened if they happened to stumble upon the biggestever recorded moose i guess its possible it makes me feel insane  you think its true give a cheer if you think its true  really give a cheer if you think its bullshit  see i dont know i think it says a lot about your worldview like if you believe in the moose youre young at heart you youve retained a sliver of like childlike enthusiasm about life and if you dont believe in the moose youre look its been a tough couple years its been tough hasnt it oh my god it really has we got to do whatever it takes to get by you know whatever makes you feel good like so my father sent me a news article recently uh he sent me this news article and was like i thought youd like this i thought youd relate to it those are the words he used i thought youd really relate to this this was the story and i havent stopped thinking about it im going to tell it to you so this it happened in the netherlands in a small town in the netherlands where basically this family noticed that they werent getting any mail they were like we havent received any mail in a long time weeks start going by theyre like wait were not even getting our bills or pamphlets in the mail this is really weird so they go to their neighbors are you guys getting your mail theyre like no this is so weird not for so long so they go to the post office and speak to like the boss the mail boss you know  you know the mail boss that you have to defeat to pass level   hes like  and um theyre like were not getting any of our mail hes like ill look into it he goes to speak to the mailman whos responsible for that block and i cant remember the mailmans name so well call him like gary well call him gary hes like gary these people are saying that theyre not getting their mail whats going on and garys like weirdly defensive right away hes like i dont know what to tell you i deliver the mail if theyre not getting mail it means no ones writing to them theyre like okay so the mail boss is like okay gary but privately to his coworkers hes like whats up with gary gary is being really weird so they decide theyre going to keep an eye on gary and investigate the sitch and so the next day gary comes to work and first red flag he picks up the mail and gets in his personal vehicle not the mail truck or whatever gets in his and he drives out of town so theyre like fuck and they followed him they follow him and he drives into the forest in the netherlands and they follow him at a distance they watch him park they park theyre keeping an eye on him they see him get out of the car he takes the bag of mail he goes into the woods hes gone  minutes he comes back out with no bag gets in his car drives away so they go in after him into the forest and imagine this this is the sight theyre confronted with okay beautiful dappled sunlight you know mist rising from the moss theres a lone moose a huge moose in the background just towering over the trees truly um  and they see as far as the eye can see there are hundreds of piles of freshly turned earth little in neat rows stretching through the forest and they dust they brush the dirt up garys been burying the mail hes been burying the mail for ages this has obviously been going on a long time and its now amped up theyre like fuck and uh they approach him the next day at work gently they approach him gently theyre like hey gar um  i we noticed youve been burying the mail and we were just wondering why are you doing that and in the news article this was the direct quote from the mailman in answer to the question why are you burying the mail this is what he said he said i did it once it felt good and now its just kind of what i do i love him hes my hero i guys gary went to jail he went to jail for eight months yeah you cant fuck with the mail thats a federal offense um he went to jail and i wanted to write him fan mail in jail but i dont want to stress him out cause hed be like i want to bury it argh  but no i really was like ive never felt so seen by my father um thats  it has been tough like im trying to get b',\n",

are gonna dissolve and just fall out of your vagina or your bum hole if you dont and you have to carry around a plastic bag just in case you have to collect your  its disgusting um so i have a couple of significant big exes but i have this one who i want to tell you this story so basically this ex it was a really intense relationship it was like four years and it was a secret relationship because it was her first nonheterosexual relationship she was like we cant tell anyone and we lived together it was so stressful and she broke up with me which is not allowed um which i thought i had made that clear  um it was a long drawnout breakup anyway so at the point where this story takes place i hadnt seen her in a year and a half or had any contact i was in london and i was doing a show and i was feeling good that night you know what i mean like i had a fresh haircut i was freshly shorn you know the feeling i was wearing a crisp black tshirt and  crisper than this im sorry about this this is crumpled crumplestiltskin over here  do you remember rumpelstiltskin  what happened to him he used to be everywhere we used to always talk about him when youre a kid rumpelstiltskin this rumpelstiltskin now you never hear about him i get it its hard to stay relevant you know hes like faded into obscurity anyway so im feeling good on this particular night feeling crisp feeling shorn and uh and also my best friend joe was with me that night he was in the audience of my show i love having joe in the audience hes a generous laugher hes a real angel like my best best friend and um i do the show it goes well and i go to the green room afterwards out the green room door to meet joe and im it was a good show im like hey man fun show but hes like green just all the color has left his face and he just goes shes here and im like fuck i know exactly who he means right away so im like okay and he goes look shes upstairs she doesnt know youre in the building she came to the bar to have a drink with some of our mutual friends he goes lets just sneak out the back lets have a fun night well go to a different bar and i thought about it and then i thought no i dont want to have a fun night so im like no well go upstairs we go up im feeling confident i see there she is with our mutual friends and um you guys would have been very proud of me i walk over very cool  what does that mean i walk over uh um no i walk over feeling confident and im also i have the element of surprise she doesnt know im in the building i think this is gonna work in my favor so i walk over go hey our mutual friends they all know how bad the breakup was by this point so they see me coming i go hey hows it going she',\n",
       "  's like oh my god hi she stands up we hug its really nice i go great to see you hey i heard you got that part thats so great shes like yeah congrats on stuff and im like yeah great its going well and i suddenly think you know what i need to be the one to end this interaction right i need to retain control of the situation like i need to we talked for a while and i go listen so good to see you she goes you want to sit down im no no im gonna hang with my friends at the bar but its really nice to see you we hug again she sits down im walking to the bar and shes still kinda casting glances over her shoulder as i walk to the bar and as im walking to the bar i suddenly realize what friends at the bar there are no friends at the bar joe has sat down at her table hes a snake hes dead to me im panicking cause shes still kinda looking and im walking to the bar thank god at the last second i see three girls who were in my show they were in the front row of my show so im approaching the bar thank god one of them goes hey great show tonight so i think i think probably what she wanted out of that interaction like what she expected from that interaction was kind of like hey great show tonight oh cheers thanks for coming what she got was so intense i was like hi how are you what are all of your names and jobs so tactile as well weirdly tactile like my arm around all their shoulders like my head on their shoulder im like mm  theyre like whoa okay uh were chatting then thank god we start chatting its going well were getting along so im like crisis averted theyre like you want a drink im like yeah were having a drink and i suddenly feel a tap on my shoulder and i look around and its my big ex this time she has the element of surprise because i wasnt expecting it she goes hey sorry to interrupt i want to say bye im leaving now im like yeah yeah and we hug and she said something awful like like im sure our paths will cross one day you know what i mean something like that where all my organs dissolve get the plastic bag out oh god um  and so we hug and shes leaving she turns shes still kind of saying goodbye to some people here and i turn back to my friends and suddenly like i guess i just got overwhelmed and the floodgates just open and i just start sobbing so no my face like crumbles my shoulders im literally just like  theyre like oh my god are you okay and i just go laugh laugh  laugh it was psychotic behavior im literally like fucking laugh ah  and theyre all like hahahaha   theres no real punchline to that story its just a vignette if you will to illustrate the level of emotion im operating on i mean i have a lot of feelings do you guys have a lot of feelings  its exhausting you know im full to the absolute brim with feelings i always visualize um like campbells tomato soup that its you know what i mean campbells cream of tomato soup and then im full to brim right to the top of my skull just trying to keep it contained just trying to keep it from sloshing out of my orifices as i make my way through life thats how i feel about my feelings all it takes is one person goes how are you and its like fling like it shoots out my ear theyre like oh god im like im sorry   thats not about you  no im all right i got a therapist recently yeah yeah yeah  yeah you have to guys you do like well if youre gonna complain as much as i complain unfortunately you do have to get one um yeah i feel like my friends were starting to be like you should pay someone to do what you expect of us i was like oh okay i found this therapist and hes really smart and we zoom and he said something interesting where he said remember you are not the feeling sure you feel consumed by the feeling but you are not the feeling he said within you and within everyone theres a very still neutral eternal self and you experience the feelings but youre not consumed by them he said rather than identifying so much with the feeling like im anxious im this he said dont be consumed by the feeling just observe the feelings as they come with curiosity have you heard that before apparently thats the so i think youre just supposed to be like huh im experiencing rage how curious how curious  i had a really um weird thing where during the pandemic i spent the whole pandemic in london i was just in my apartment in the rain in london for years  and uh i noticed an unexpected feeling bubbling up where i was why do i feel embarrassed like i would wake up feeling embarrassed and i was spending a lot of time obviously in my apartment in my living room and in my bedroom specifically and i was like wait okay maybe its this okay stay with me dont you think its kind of embarrassing that were adults and we still have rooms okay stay wait that were like this is my room hm this is my room dont go in my room  its embarrassing i have to clean my room and like please i of course accept and understand that we need rooms you need four walls within which to lay your weary head each night but i think what i find so embarrassing about it is like the way we decorate our rooms to reflect our individuality and were like im me right im myself in my room its so embarrassing i have one himalayan salt lamp yes i do and im me i have my picture on the wall and i when you f',\n",
       "  'inish reading a book you never get rid of it youre like i put it on the shelf in my that is my personality on display for all to see  no one else is me and then i was thinking okay this is a little abstract but dont you think in a way our brains and our minds are like our rooms and we furnish our minds with experiences that we collect to then build what we think of as our identity and selves and thats all were doing were little experience hunters collecting these to put them on our brain shelves and be like im me and i always visualize every experience that we collect is like a little novelty snow globe were just going around being like one time i saw antonio banderas at the airport yes i did im myself and no one else is me  and then all human interaction is really i really noticed this coming out of the pandemic all interaction is just basically taking turns showing each other our snow globes and being like i and just pathetically taking turns and like someone will be showing you their snow globe you know and youre trying to be a good listener its a story about a party they went to five years ago and youre like yes and you are you as well like yes exactly yes how wonderful to be yourself as well but the whole time your eyes are darting to your own shelf a hundred percent the whole time youre like mmm yes well no yes waiting for your moment to be like and me as well i have one   thank you this is so exciting you know what i was thinking well i watch a lot of standup specials then my friends special came out recently and they put out the trailer i was like fuck its so dynamic like shes so physical onstage and doing i was like i dont really move much like im very then i was like what if cause i really want my trailer to be dynamic so i was like what if i just i know in my head the things i want to see in my trailer i just havent written the jokes that go with the movements so i was like maybe i just do the movements and then i put it in the trailer and its just like just like this thats in the trailer how good would that be youd be like i gotta watch that  i should just have like a hundred trained dogs they all come out on the stage like this and theyre all on their hind legs jumping and then we just have it in the trailer and never in the show  um yeah feelings i got a lot of feelings so rage embarrassment these are some of the feelings um another feeling that i its very dominant in my life and i think a lot of people relate to this its like nostalgia im very nostalgic you know and i know thats kind of a useless emotion like im im nostalgic for prepandemic times and we didnt know how good we had it im very nostalgic really for prepuberty if im being honest thats where it all went wrong like yeah and my friends are like oh yeah you missed the  thats so original do you miss how all of our parents used to have a lot of rubber bands do you remember how everyone had rubber bands youd find them around drawer handles and shit thered be a whole ball of them what were they for i have no rubber bands now do you miss how all parents had one big conch shell in the bathroom im like yes yes i do miss that yeah and i miss the easier access to abortion and less populism yeah you know what i mean yeah  i do feel i think im someone who i never really got over puberty well for a couple of reasons i think puberty hit me like a ton of bricks really first of all im exactly the demographic where um for me puberty coincided almost exactly with the arrival of the internet and the popularization of the internet im so lucky i had like one to  kind of it wasnt around and i remember the one computer in our classroom got the internet and overnight the world just exploded everything changed it was like we all got our first email addresses mine was hotmaeelhotmailcom  thank you those were the days you could get the good email addresses but it was like overnight the world went from being very manageable everything i needed to know was in just in one set of encyclopedia britannicas in my parents basement it was so relaxing it was like a finite amount of facts that was it the nice thin paper you know what i mean it was manageable it wasnt also it was like objective truth like no one was putting out the devils advocate set of encyclopedias you know what i mean like well are you sure lima is the capital of peru um  and then overnight it was like i was obsessed with it i remember my friends at lunch being like were gonna go out and play at recess wanna come id be like no theres so much work to be done on the internet theres so much going on i was like i have to copy and paste images of buffy the vampire slayer into a word document i then have to print that word document the paper will be sodden with ink just heavy with ink like i have to cut those pictures out and its going to be like cutting wet toilet paper i then have to stick those pictures onto my homework diary like im busy i i truly feel like ive been busy ever since im exhausted and another reason that i think puberty really hit me was like okay so yeah regular puberty stuff then the internet arrives and the stuff that brings with it and then for me also puberty triggered kind of a wild gender dysphoria and a gender thing you know what i mean  ye',\n",
       "  'ah  uhhuh dead silence um no but really like before puberty i felt like i was this bounding androgynous child very confident did a lot of ace ventura impersonations and then suddenly puberty hit and my bodys changing i felt very like and this was the  too this was the era of girl bands and boy bands right this was the very popfueled binary and i went to an allgirls school which i just like the ubiquitous question the question you needed to know an answer to at my school was which spice girl are you and it was like theres only five possible answers you needed to know youd be in the hall and a group of girls would corner you which one are you cause theyre organizing lipsyncs and stuff they need to know no judgment they did need to know where you fit into the constellation it was like which one are you and i was like justin timberlake i dont know nick carter um i think regardless if you experience gender stuff puberty anyway is a fucking nightmare like you feel like an alien and everything that was cool about you just becomes worthless overnight like okay i had this trick okay well its a noise that i can make with my hand and i swear it was really popular people loved when i did it it killed at parties im going to do it for you now uh okay maybe some of you remember this um okay this is the noise  do you remember that guys i swear it used to kill at parties people would request it theyd be like do the noise id be like okay i did it in a school assembly once that was that was too far but um it was really cool and then all of a sudden puberty hit suddenly im at a house party im in a cupboard with a pimply  boy whos got a semi and im like  and hes like what the fuck hes like i thought you were gonna give me a hand job im like no i said that i could do something cool with my hand  he leaves me alone in the cupboard im there in the dark by myself like  really mournful  its hard to live at that age its really i mean dont you think that the only way to flirt when youre  the only acceptable way is to go how big are your hands thats dont you think do you remember that how big are your hands i still kinda think thats a great move to make physical contact with someone that you like except i was at my allgirls school just sort of slightly getting it wrong yeah my hands are pretty massive yeah yours are tiny of course going around the playground being like well you know what they say big hands massive labia   but so all that was going on you know and i think for everyone at puberty you do kind of you develop critical thinking and suddenly sort of the hard facts of life are hitting you i think if youre like different in any way like if the dominant narrative thats being told to you by everyone doesnt match what youre experiencing know what i mean like with gender people being like theres two and youre a woman and this is what its like and youre like okay but youre experiencing something completely different then you kind of have two options you can either question the validity of yourself and your experience or you can question the validity of everything else and the whole system once you start pulling that thread youre fucked its like monogamy youre like can i bring two people to prom why not i dont get why not and i really felt and also like for me i um i started doing comedy when i was  and i discovered i got really into drugs like psychedelic drugs so that just exacerbated the general existential wave like i felt like i was peeling back the wallpaper on reality and i was seeing this very flimsy scaffolding holding everything up i was just like what is going on you suddenly realize your parents are flawed your teachers are like lonely or something i remember being mm i think ms buchanans lonely i feel a huge amount of pressure to laugh at her jokes and i dont know um and yeah i remember being really stressed by why dont we as a society talk more about the fact that the movie antz and the movie a bugs life came out in the same year surely powerful forces are at play here and were just not going to address it like what the um yeah so yeah i was stressed and and also i think with drugs it was a way to get out of my body i was feeling very uncomfortable in my body and it was this trap door and so i got heavily into drugs and the bullet points are i went from psychedelics into like the really bad ones i got kicked out of my house i dropped out of school fastforward i ended up in rehab when i was  i went to a rehab day program for nine months uh a rehab day program for teens objectively a bad idea well in a way right like you get a group of teenagers together all they have in common is they love doing drugs every day at  pm the bell goes and theyre like off you go with your new friends run along bond in the alleyways the only way you know how  um but it was very eyeopening for me it was a big turning point because i got into this program and there were  other kids in there i was suddenly like oh fuck these kids have come from actually difficult lives and difficult family situations like who am i you know im this privileged middleclass kid what am i rebelling against really but i needed to be there and it was good i wanted to fit in with all these kids theyd been there a while they were',\n",
       "  ' all really bonded and they had nicknames for each other ive never had a nickname and i wanted to be in on it i was very excited because after like two months in the program i came in one morning and one of the guys goes yo bath water whats up i was like bath water and they all start calling me bath water then the teacher starts calling me it catches on the teachers are good morning bath water im like what is happening but i get into it i dont want to admit that i dont know why theyre calling me bath water im like yup not much all good yeah and then finally i get comfortable enough with them and we all get close im like guys ive been meaning to ask you for months why do you call me bath water and they said oh its because when you arrived we all had a conversation and decided you look like the type of kid who would drink their own bath water its so specific so insulting and creative yes drink their own i mean look ive drunk some bath water in my time sure havent we all i mean not like with   with a straw just no but like we all weve all drunk some havent we okay wait do you remember bath time remember bath time did you ever um in bath time take your wet flannel do you call it a flannel or a facecloth flannel yeah canada yeah  did you ever take your wet flannel and lie it on your face and breathe through it and then you suddenly feel like youre waterboarding yourself youre like oh no god or did you ever suck the water out of your flannel right it feels so squeaky on your what a feeling bath time you know what i mean know what i miss most ill move on from bath time but i will just quickly say what i miss most about bath time is just once a day somebody going uh its bath time how good is that i feel like we dont appreciate it when were young but imagine youre on a shitty tinder date and the waiter comes over theyre like im so sorry to interrupt um it is bath time for you youre like youd be out of there  youth is wasted on the young you know youth is wasted on the young um yeah so thats yeah i think the reason that i obsess over my teens and im constantly processing it is that i feel like a completely different person now and i did have this kind of chaotic adolescence and it was really dark like it was crazy now i feel truly like a completely different person like im very risk averse now you yeah you should see me on an escalator its insane i hold so tight to the railing im very like  as the things approaching oh my god im like one two three go waiting for my moment  if im not ready and its coming im walking backwards im going okay one two  yeah yeah but i do still i feel different i do i guess still get that selfdestructive feeling like that pressure building up i feel like we all kind of sometimes have those impulses and you have to find the healthy way to deal with those feelings um i do a lot of escape rooms im always escaping a room constantly um like i was on tour recently and touring is intense also i tour by myself i dont usually have an opening act or a tour manager or whatever i just travel by myself i have these long days in these random cities in the uk and i was doing a show in edinburgh i was scotland in edinburgh by myself for the day and i was having the feeling of pressure building up you know what i mean and like i had just seen trainspotting so i was like were in the danger zone and uh i said what should i do so i go online and i found the edinburgh dungeons were open thats kind of like the london dungeons where its like this horror immersive horror experience where actors dress up like victorians and scare you and you walk through a maze of hell so i was like great um and i got the vip package as well which is just you pay  extra bucks and all it meant was when i arrived they take a picture of you in front of a green screen and then they give you a key and they project a graveyard and give you the keychain of the that was when i was like oh this is something you should do with friends  friends or loved ones i do now have a keychain thats just so i go down and its me and this group of strangers and were going to go together as a group through this horror maze its tourists and families theres like ten of us were about to go through it and this guy comes out and hes dressed like a kind of victorian butcher hes covered in blood and hes got a big butchers knife big beard scottish guy and he goes im the butcher i cant do the accent very well hes like welcome to the edinburgh dungeons were gonna fucking kill you and im like yes yes ive been praying for death um then he goes but first i do have a few safety announcements um if you are pregnant or you do have epilepsy dont go in the dungeon uh im like okay then he said at no point will any of the actors in the dungeon touch you or grab you so i was like thats good right nobody wants to be grabbed in the dunge so i was like sweet um so we start going through and guys its so scary like its just im quaking with fear im with these strangers going through they do this thing where they love to turn off all the lights pitchblack and then when they come back on theres a woman standing an inch from your face and being like  its so scary but im loving it im like ah theres sort of a narrative arc where at the very begin',\n",
       "  'ning the butcher was like youre gonna meet the legendary cannibal sawney bean does anybody know sawney bean legendary cannibal apparently and were like we dont want to meet him were frightened hes like oh no hes going to love you guys we know its building to something and we get to this part where theres a sort of boat underground were in the bowels of edinburgh right and theres a boat on a track and we all get in it and we can hear sawney bean in the darkness toward where were headed going im sawney bean were like no the butcher goes okay guys youre on your own now im leaving you were like no wait weve learned to love you we need you hes like fuck you guys and he leaves now its me and my group and were in the little boat the lights go off and its pitchblack you cant see your hand in front of your face its so dark and its damp and its cold we can hear im sawney bean and im freaking out then i feel these hands on my back going up my back and kind of coming around my neck and im freaking out because im remembering theyre not allowed to touch you in the dunge right im like whats happening the lights come back i spin round and theres just this middleaged woman whos part of our group and she just goes  ooh it was insane oohhooooh and she was with her two teenaged daughters who are sitting on either side of her theyre like mom what the fuck are you doing shes like ooh i think about her all the time shes like the mailman shes a hero you know a hero to us all  but yeah i do things like that to you know to feel alive and um yeah i try to be very vigilant about my brain because i have a lot of shame about my teens i behaved very badly you know i was very selfdestructive and i the weird thing is i was so angry i was really angry and uh the weird thing is since like  i remember when trump got elected i was like so we cant deny anymore that the world is slightly off its axis its a little fucked right we have so much information available to us now its hard to deny the system doesnt work for everyone like billionaires dont pay taxes and all the stuff we know so im like okay in a way my anger was valid i think a lot of teenagers feel this righteous indignation and stuff but the method of my rebellion was garbage like it was so selfdestructive and selfinvolved you know it was impotent ultimately i got this tattoo when i was  it says oatmeal um it says oatmeal twice i remember being like fuck the man you know like what  so thats there for good uh  i i remember feeling like i felt like the world was a house that had been sold to me at a very young age when i was too young to be signing mortgages a house that was sold to me by a really shady realtor like a kind of greasy with a a doggystyle baby realtor  sign here kid and im like okay all your dreams will come true i sign it suddenly im in this house you develop critical thinking you wake up in the house in your teens youre like wait hang on the foundations of the house are rotten the backyards on fire cause the previous owners kept heating it with fossil fuels exclusively so my reaction was i thought all right ill just bulldoze the house with myself in it and of course now i realize what i should have done is put any amount of energy into fixing the house right thats what we need to do is thats hopefully what were trying to do we have to right put some energy into making the house a nicer place to live cause it wont do it yeah  i do feel we have to consciously do it or else it wont happen you know um and thats why i am really i love i feel like gen z is incredible i dont believe that theyre just on tiktok i think theyre wicked theyre out there theyre doing stuff you know protesting climate change and dismantling rigid gender binaries what was i doing i was slithering around being like does anyone have any acid  just like useless behavior and theyre wicked i want to talk about i want to talk about like the gender thing for a sec so  just because ive been in the uk and now im in the states and in both places theres a real hysteria right now around gender and gender identity and i think part of it comes from this misconception that its a recent gen z fad or a millennial fad right to have this fluidity around gender its like of course as long as theres been human civilization we know right theres been variances in gender theres been different cultures that recognize third and fourth genders not just recognize revere like i could have been revered i could have been revered it sucks and instead im like which bathroom am i allowed to use please um and really it is a recent colonial fad to have this very rigid gender binary its really like we just went around the world bulldozing over the nuances of all these beautiful things um in the uk where ive been living i remember in  india decriminalized homosexuality and it was great like big celebration really exciting but it was really frustrating cause the coverage of it on the news in the uk was so smug it was like its about time india and its like england went into india and criminalized homosexuality in  like its its the ultimate gaslighting its like lighting someones house on fire and being like its really awkward how long its taking out to put that out its so embarrassing  yeah thanks um yea',\n",
       "  'h and the annoying thing is i dont really want to talk about gender because its kind of loselose right especially if its something that personally affects you and you care about then its hard to debate you get emotional youve already lost cause youre like  like its hard but i feel like i should talk about it because everyone else is like comedians big multimillionaire comedians in their standup specials are like taking shots and punching down at a time when trans rights are so tenuous and slipping backwards its just not yeah and uh  no no no but i feel youre like yeah theyre slipping backwards yeah no just kidding im suddenly like oh fuck  the thing and i watch those specials so i can be informed when im asked in every interview to talk about those guys specials but like the thing that kept coming up was genders a fact that was the refrain of one genders a fact then they cut to the audience aw yeah theyre loving it and its like um i feel like im kind of preaching to the choir a little here but just to quickly say of course biological sex is real its a thing within that theres tons of variation its very much like scientifically its not as binary as we think theres intersex people theres hormonal variation all kinds of stuff but yeah for sure biological sex no one denies is real but gender is so much more ephemeral and much more what to do with whats in here and in here very much like you know a social construct and more fluid and the way i explain it to people who are trying to understand the difference between biological sex and gender is i picture the gender spectrum you know the movie beauty and the beast okay so imagine if at one end of the gender spectrum you have gaston you remember him hes like no one fights like hot hes hot hes like extreme masculinity on the other end of the spectrum you have belle who has stockholm syndrome so dark but um but guys shes still an excellent role model because she can read she loves a book you got to hand it to her um and then in the middle of the spectrum you have the candlestick right you have lumière and i really relate to lumière i connect with lumière and obviously the more we empower lumière the more fun gaston and belle are gonna have lumières throwing parties theyre like be my guest yeah i have this fantasy i have this fantasy that like its a really clear image in my head of you got dave chappelle ricky gervais louis ck throw joe rogan in there and theyre eating a hog roast in this fantasy its a huge hog and theyre ripping the flesh off it  theyre drinking goblets of mead that medieval drink theyre throwing their money and then they turn the tv on and they see me doing my little beauty and the beast gender just like and the candlestick and theyre watching it and are like oh my god we guys we were wrong oh and then they just  thats my fantasy then they just like you know what i want i want them to i want them to cradle each other i want them to hold each other gently and just gently rock i want them to reparent themselves basically just give a little that cause i do understand too i get it its hard to learn new language you know although is it like omicron you know we picked that up pretty fast um but the the joke i always hear and this has been a joke this was hack in the  this joke its come back with a vengeance on the standup circuit its like well like i identify as a cactus or i identify as a lamp post or this inanimate object and its like um yeah im nonbinary which is under the banner of trans identity in that like the sex i was assigned at birth doesnt feel like it fit  um and uh but its like i dont want to necessarily identify as nonbinary or trans i just am that i just am and to say otherwise would be bizarre it would be like doing a violence to myself thats what it would feel like it would be like the hot tomato soup thing times a hundred just full of tomato soup its tricky because its like you just have to take my word for it that i know who i am its so hard saying that to people its like i just you just have to take my word for it i am certain of it and its like i may not be certain if a toyota tercel can fit under a moose very unsure but i do know this also you dont have to understand it even you know what i mean like i do not understand wifi how does it work what is it but i know that its real i know it exists among us i just accept that its there whatever  i dont let it keep me up at night im not like yeah um yeah so i had top surgery last december and im on a low dose of testosterone for this past year and its been the best year of my life genuinely and im  years old this has been the best year of my life yeah  thanks um and its like whats weird is like im not that happy im not skipping around its truly just the absence of agony thats all it is and thats a low bar and who are we to deny anybody that the absence of agony yeah thats going to be my  thats going to be my album title um yeah okay and also im really just so grateful to have the language now right growing up i didnt have that language but i always felt this way and i remember being you know when youre four or five and your parents tell the story of your birth you know and i feel like my parents it sounds like they were always talking about my con',\n",
       "  'ception and my birth i swear we had normal conversations as well but i remember my dad telling me your mother went into labor we went to the hospital he was saying maybe youll have your own kids one day and im imagining having my own kids in my fantasy of having children i was never the one having the kids it was a really specific fantasy where i was this  businessman father just like pacing the halls of the hospital smoking just really like a very  dalmatians vibe then some nurse would be like its a boy and id be like cheers gentlemen ill name it buster send it down the mines um yeah okay were almost at the end i have one more thing to tell you im gonna get my mic stand if i yeah imagine if i lost it so i feel like and by the way thank you so much this has been really youve been amazing  i feel like weve been through like in terms of our worldview weve been through pessimism and optimism and i really want to end on a positive note so i want to tell you this buddhist parable that i love um this is stay with me so i love this story um and then im gonna go it takes place in the forest actually were back in the forest and basically in this parable this man is being chased pursued through the forest by what i can only describe as a beast from hell like a really terrifying creature with a lions jaws and this monstrous body its nature is pure hunger it wants to devour this man and its been chasing him for days and hes been running and hes starting to get exhausted at some point hes going to succumb to the beast just when he thinks hes gonna pass out and the beast is gonna get him he sees this little stone well in the middle of the forest little circular well hes like ill hide in the well from the beast he jumps in sure enough the beast doesnt follow him it stops at the top and is like  hes like great hes falling down the well and as hes falling he feels water splashing up onto his feet hes like thats weird and he looks down and below him where hes headed the water is churning wildly and he realizes whats at the bottom of the well another beast yeah its a double beast situash bad bad news beast at the top beast below  like that and at the last second he sees this branch growing out of the side of the well like a gnarly branch so he grabs onto it and he uses his last remaining strength to maneuver himself up onto this branch and his muscles are quivering but hes like i made it the beast is there the beast below and the branch is creaking under his weight like this is not a permanent solution right at some point the branch is going to give out and hes sweating hes sweating in that crease here you know if youre sweating in that crease you are in trouble and suddenly he looks to the end of the branch and he sees something glistening on the end hes like what is that and so he balances and he reaches out with one finger to the end of the branch and he gets it on his finger its golden glistening tree sap its tree sap and he puts it in his mouth and hes like is that thats delicious guys its positive wait thats thats it no hello  okay okay uh trust me i find it very positive you got to get on board please ive called the show sap you truly must get on board like this was not cheap  no but i really do find it positive because its like look life might be a double beast situash that might be just what life in a way is it not know what i mean but luckily theres so much sap and we have to just to take the time its worth it to enjoy the sap and cultivate it where we can and luckily theres an abundance of sap i think like everywhere you look if you look hard you got dogs every dog on this earth like a good pair of jeans thats sap that can be sap the beatles for me are sap um your friends the tv show friends no like having friends um sex is good sex with your friends is pretty good um scaring people ooh yeah if thats i like campfires roasting marshmallows the song bennie and the jets by elton john um yeah hugs and sparklers christmas lights all those things are fully sap all those things can be sap and genuinely this may be corny but truly this is sap for me doing this makes me so happy and its sap for me

       "  'der thank you very much of just how bad things used to be i luckily have this this is an interview that i gave to gq magazine that i have absolutely no memory of giving  have you ever had a conversation on drugs that you dont remember the next day was it a very long interview  i gave this interview december   my intervention was december   so its bad that it was before i guess what happened was a reporter called me and he said hey id like to interview you i was on a lot of cocaine and i dont know if you know how cocaine works but that is great news  so i want to share a few highlights from this interview that i have no memory of giving beginning with a line in their introduction which says gq hopped on the phone with the comedian for a wide ranging conversation  first question gq what are you up to today mulaney i walked past what is supposedly the most haunted building in new york city  gq oh  where is that mulaney its a vacuum cleaner store and its on  between  and  and it used to be a boarding house my oh my apparently just incredibly haunted and im talking like poltergeist haunted  gq okay  did you get a chill or a bad vibe mulaney it doesnt give me a bad vibe anymore i think when i first walked past it i knew what it was so maybe i faked the bad vibes what  what could he mean by the way they have editors they could have helped me out  i think when i first walked past it i knew what it was so maybe i faked the bad vibes although i walked by a house that was haunted in los angeles once i didnt know it was haunted i was just kind of like oh whats this house  and then slowly i was like nah i dont like this house   im going to walk away from here with my dog  and then i found out it was called the murder house of los feliz and then i found out that it had a terrible history yes thats the only time that ive really had a creeping sense of ghouls and ghosts out of nowhere and then have it to be proven totally correct   no there was not another question asked in the midst of that run i am still answering the question what did you do today  also i goddamn love that i used the word ghouls  when do you get to say that next question gq i want to talk to you about how this year has been for you creatively because around this time last year you were coming off of the sack lunch bunch which was arguably one of your biggest creative risks and it really paid off how has your creative process been impacted by this year mulaney  if you heard that spoon drop its cause im eating a bowl of fruit loops   phenomenal phenomenal answer to any question in life always call out and identify every noise in a room it doesnt come off paranoid at all next question gq magazine watching you on late night with seth meyers made me wonder would you ever want your own talk show mulaney okay so  i had two ideas for a talk show once  lets pause and appreciate that sentence for a sec i had two ideas for a talk show once  and by ideas i mean i thought about them in the privacy of my own room  one idea would be just interviewing people who do anything that interests me and i dont mean like im on the ground and im watching them do their job no it would be like a talk show set and theyd come out there and thered be a band and so forth  okay lets pause right here so just to recap i had two ideas for a talk show once and the first of these is a talk show   the other idea was to have a show and just have on only elderly people  which i obviously would not do now due to the risks     but i just thought it would be great to talk to old people especially if they were comfortable talking about being at the end of their lives  next question gq speaking of television  you had that sitcom that didnt pan out but that was such a long time ago were in an era where networks and all these different streaming services are giving creators seemingly more room to make the shows that they want given that would you try it again mulaney are you talking about a multicam live audience sitcom the way i did it gq no   not necessarily mulaney i would do the exact same show i did before and the only thing i would change is the audience   and heres how it wraps up gq i think what weve established in this conversation is that there are a ton of different ideas rattling around in your head that you should definitely make happen mulaney if thats what people take away from this id be thrilled  gq okay  im going to let you go i dont want to take too much of your time away from the fruit loops   mulaney what are you talking about   theyre long gone good night boston thank you very very much   '],\n",

mumbai in four and a half minutes do you wanna get a bet in yes yes yes yes yes i dont i dont even know how to play cricket but theres only two teams i got a  chance right out of the gate set it down literally four minutes later bing hey kathleen theres a womens tennis tournament starting in eastern europe would you like to bet on individual players yes any lady that ends it ova  i want  on all the ova  surely one more win and then ill cover that bet the only thing i did learn which was alarming is that ive been washing my hands wrong for  years yeah sanjay gupta the buzzkill he was on some show and he said in order to wash your hands properly you have to wash your hands for three minutes  exactly im like three minutes sir i am involved in a cricket match in mumbai right now like im a busy lady i dont know what you got going on i didnt wanna fight during covid i hated all the fighting so i tried it to avoid any situations except at one point i had to drive through kentucky and none of the normal gas stations were open so i had to go to a backass hillbilly gas station and i walked in and i had a mask on at the time and the lady there was only one person and theres the lady working in there and shes smoking a cig and in this hand she had a scratch off lottery ticket and i thought oh wow she stil',\n",
       "  'l has hope i like it but when she saw my mask she went  so i was like whatever i went to the bathroom i got a soda i got pretzels and sat them down she looked at me with such disdain she goes i just want you to know we dont got corona here i said thats okay because i mostly only drink bud light  and she goes what i go i know right and then i ran away i literally ran i left the soda i dropped  i made it rain and then i ran away i was so and i was on a roll before covid because ive been on the road for like  years and i was like you know what i should start doing some bucket list stuff that i wanna do before i decide to quit the road and one of the things ive always wanted to do was go ice fishing because it looks fun and i booked myself at a casino in the upper peninsula of michigan no yeah if youve never been there uh it is beautiful its probably some of the most beautiful landscapes ive ever seen but the people um i would describe them and i think they would be proud of this i would describe them as feral like they are not properly socialized like when youre talking to them they have long pauses im like are we done or do you have more thoughts this is not a normal rhythm to a conversation theyre all real nice though the lady in charge of the gig i say can you find somebody to take me ice fishing on saturday she called me back she goes okay kathleen i found a guy thats gonna take you and i promise hes not a pervert what why would you say something like that like what are you trying to get out in front of whats going on up here in the past because i mean im still going but now im gonna be thinking about that the whole time i mean just looking at this strange man going in im either gonna catch some fish or out of nowhere hes gonna sexually assault me but then i thought yeah but i bought so many different pieces of clothing from bass pro shop i would almost challenge him like if you could get it off you win it because you wont you wont get it off because i dont know how i got it on im never getting out of these clothes be the first metoo from what i saw metoo i wanted to support the women of the me too movement but like at one point i turned on cnn and they literally the people in charge were chasing chuck grassley down the senator from iowa down a hallway to speak to him about the me too movement  ladies chuck is an  farmer from iowa he doesnt even understand why youre out like of the house like its a tuesday where are your children you two bad whores and if youre here whos making supper for your husband i dont understand whats happening hes  hes not gonna get it dont waste your time on him like old guys its some of it is generational my dad doesnt get it and my dads very liberal but hes also  this is his me too thing he goes this me too thing i mean obviously i dont wanna see you girls get attacked at work thanks dad thats a good thought i like going to work with that thought you know what today dads on my side about not getting attacked he goes but seriously this for me too thing are we gonna take it too far hmm are you not even gonna be able to wink at a gal in your office nobodys doing that anymore dad i dont know i dont know when it was popular like back in the  when bewitched was on or whatever and you guys would all go get shitfaced at lunch and then just go back and wink your ass off as nobody you thought was superhot uhuh all right dad if you winked a little at a millennial they wouldnt even know what you were doing they would just be like oh my god theres something wrong with mr madigans eye like every time i walk by his office hes like maybe he has that dry eye jennifer aniston talks about in those commercials right like we should get them those drops as a secret santa and just leave them there for him in the me too movement all the men that were accused what was crazy is the media it didnt matter who was accused another rich powerful boss guy theyd go is it this shocking no because the men youre talking about are in charge and theyre the boss and they have money and power itll be shocking like if you told me jerry from the bowling alley did all that shit im like what stop it youre kidding me jerry cant do it because jerry has no power jerry only has power over shoes thats jerrys area and nobody cares about your bowling shoes you take what youre given and youre happy its just that easy but like no matter what guy charlie rose was one of the big ones because they thought he was such an esteemed journalist charlie rose im not saying he did it i have no idea but to be accused not shocking it would be shocking if you told me charlie rose was a furry ill be like what no way what animal is he i wanna know i judge people on what animal they chose and if you dont know what a furry is do not feel stupid i didnt know them until three years ago i was sitting in a san jose marriot bar that was attached to the convention center and it was my day off and all of these people in elaborate animal costumes started coming in and i was like wow theyre impressive right and i in my mind i thought oh it must be a mascot convention right you know cause they work alone they probably like to get together and complain about work like we all do but then as they kept coming in im like you know i know a lot about sports and i dont recognize any of these mascots so then all on my own i decided oh i bet its minor league you know because there are so many teams you cant keep up the savannah bananas you know like too many so the bartender came back and i go when how long are the mascots in town hes like what lady those are furries i go oh whats a furry he goes well im not one of them and ',\n",
       "  'i dont wanna answer that question i said well my phones dead come on i cant google it he goes well theyre like millennial type age people and they like to dress up like animals and then they come to these conventions and some of them just wanna be the animal and then others wanna hook up as the animal okay i said well can i just ask one followup question um if if youre gonna hook up do you have to stay within your species or is that taboo like can the beagle get with the iguana if nobody knows or like he was like yeah and then he walked away im like well i still wanted a beer i know that you didnt like that conversation im like wow thats what a lot of the millennials are doing on weekends and you know what i am a fan of the millennials because theyre the first generation that has realized that if you live with your parents long enough eventually theyll be glad youre there yes its gonna take a while but grind it out millennials cause when your when your parents are  and they see you in the kitchen theyll be like hey can you drive at night thats fantastic we wanna go to bingo on friday at  whats your name again matt okay matt so matt did you leave ever or did you fail and come back or did you just have you been here we forgot i am frequently shocked though when youre dealing with millennials in the general public and i think its kind of nice i guess that they truly believe on some level that strangers care about them like i was in lowes and i had all these tiny paint samples and paint brushes i just i set em down and then i the guy was like  whatever and i go hey how are you doing man he goes uh not good lady not good he said i just saw the work schedule and i was supposed to have three days off in a row because i worked three days in a row and i dont and i dont even know if i wanna work here anymore and in my head i thought oh my god he thought i meant that i dont really care how you are sir i barely care that im here i that was just a pleasantry those are nice things you say to keep society moving and forward progress so we dont kill each other with barbecue equipment on weekends like nobody cares yeah i thats why i think we could use a little bit more to people being nice in public and pleasant because i think everybody forgot to behave how to behave in the general public like i went into a taco bell yeah like be nice its not that hard people have just flipped their lids like i went to a taco bell now theres only two girls theyre probably in their  and theres only two employees cause were not employees anymore ones trying to fix the drivethru which is broken which is why i went in and theres one girl thats gonna wait on me and theres a man ahead of me hes about  she tells him theyre completely out of mild sauce and he loses it he just loses it and he starts yelling and screaming and in my mind im like dude that is the last lady on the titanic handing out life jackets like dont piss her off because thats the  they will quit sir i dont think you understand they will fucking leave in a minute and they all agree on that its like they formed a union without ever having a meeting its and i think their union should be called yeah no cause they wont  and good for them you know cause it never occurred to our generation hey i could just leave here nope never even thought about it oh man this blows but im gonna stay cause i thought id die but im looking at him going hes still yelling at the girl im like if she quits sir do you understand we have to do it do you know how to make a gordita i dont i want a softshelled chalupa no idea then i went out to the car and my sister goes oh i saw that guy losing his mind what was he saying i said it doesnt even matter what he was saying i can tell you this though i know it was for uh certainty we as a nation are not prepared for war that was mild sauce not even fire he went that crazy sometimes i wish the millennials could be a little more flexible though cause i think theyre linear cause they grew up with the computer they fully trust the computer um to the point where sometimes theyre like i was babysitting my brothers three kids and i called to get pizzas to be delivered and the girl goes whats the address and i gave it to her she goes hmm yeah thats not coming up on gps so we cant bring your pizza oh im like can we do it the old way or ill just tell you how to get here and then youll come with pizza and then ill just throw a bunch of crumpled dollar bills in your direction with tips and all that she goes no because we were taught in training that if you go to a house that has a gps address that doesnt come up thats exactly how you get lured to your own death what so i said just to see i wanted to see if i would get a reaction i go yeah cause i remember like in the  and  all those pizza kids that were murdered like every weekend wed lose another  and then more signed up i dont even know that was just in the midwest i dont even know the coastal counts and she just goes yeah bye like i dont she may have believed it not sure theyre a trusting bunch the millennials which i appreciate i like i think its nice i dont think my group not trusting at all like during covid one of the things that was really weird is like most of my normal friends and my relatives they still had to go to work so they had stuff to do so nobody wanted to participate in my world and like one day i called my brother he worked at a bank and i go hey pat youre not gonna believe this but theres a king cobra loose in grand prairie texas cause some asshole forgot to put the lid on his cobra cage and its just running around a normal neighborhood and my brother goes well y',\n",
       "  'oure not gonna believe this kathleen but i have a job and he hung up boo boo patrick so then i texted him i knew that would make him mad im like so i guess you dont care about the zebras loose in maryland either then do you pat you wanna know more call me back so i didnt have anybody to talk to so i thought well i started madigans pubcast cause i thought well theres gonna be a lot of yeah its fun people somebody wants to hear these stories right cause theyre true its important theres a cobra loose for christs sake but i had a millennial hit me up on instagram and she wrote im coming to see your show in austin cause i love your podcast i didnt know you were a comedian okay fair enough you know shes young whatever fair enough but i was very curious i go just out of curiosity cause she had bought a ticket i go what did you think i was gonna do when you got there and she wrote back well i didnt know i thought wow thats so trusting like im  ive never bought a ticket to a surprise show in my life i got  bucks lets see whats going on in that building i do wish the millennials though would step it up in this one department i would like them to run for office id like them to try to be in charge yeah cause the people in charge right now um we are being governed by a florida bridge club and nobody seems alarmed and nobody wants to say nothing cause youre being mean to meemaw no i dont i dont give a shit anymore it has gotten it has gone over the rainbow chuck grassley the  from iowa announced on twitter and i know hes doing his own tweets you know how i know that because he signs them okay papaw you dont have to do that he announced hes running again no papaw no you are  you go home now thats what you do when youre  and it doesnt yeah  it doesnt mean that you dont have worth and you dont have value but you gotta find something else to do instead of being in charge of  million people okay papaw heres like my dad was a lawyer my dad retired and then my dad became a golf marshal thats appropriate if you dont know what a golf marshal is its an old guy that gets in a cart and then he drives around the course and yells at other old people to hurry their asses up because not everybody has  hours to play four holes and its both sides of the aisle i mean theres no difference i mean nancy pelosi i dont really know for sure how old she is but some days i know for sure her teeth dont fit right i know that i know that cause it happens to my mom its a bridge issue theres like a clip that goes on that fang tooth and if it slips its not good like my mom will be speaking like a totally normal human being and then its just fullon liza minnelli  mom fix it clip it back on you sound like youre having a stroke and i dont know but nancy will do it live on tv just come out for a press conference hi everybody its me nancy pelosi and today id like you id like to discuss insurance im like ah fix it affordable healthcare insurance thats what i like to talk about i dont know sign language it looks like i do actually my hands just do this cause im italian we talk with our hands thats why i have such good skin cause im italian im actually im  nobody knows that no no over  mitch mcconnell the talking turtle from kentucky no i just cant look at you anymore its over now the mans never voted yes for anything you know i vote no on everything thats my thing sometimes if i havent voted no in a while ill write a bill just to vote against myself so i stay in practice and im not saying the millennials would be any smarter i dont know but i know for sure they dont have grudges that go back so far theyre not repairable because i havent had the time to have em when you hear these these people fighting and mitch mcconnell well i remember when nancy pelosi voted against the spanishamerican war i was like you californiasaladeating pienutlovingfruitcakepieceofshit them boys at the alamo would be alive if it wasnt for nancy pelosi and so the only time ive ever voted yes in my life reinforcements for mr david crockett stop its crazy and then who are we presented with more  bernie sanders said hes probably pretty sure hes gonna run again bernie is like from the bible old like i if you could bet on draftkings one person is still alive from the bible id throw a hundred on bernie im like yes and i liked bernie i had a soft spot for him cause to me every time he showed up somewhere he always looked like he may have just been involved in a car accident im sorry im late let me take off my mittens the maid in vermont by a woman named naomi if youd like a pair go to my website i thought biden was too old and i dont know why nobody helps the guy like i dont get it like when hes out giving speeches i would do it for free ill be in charge of ill be in charge of him cause heres what i would say to him i go joe heres the deal guess what were not gonna do anymore story times were not ixnay on the stories okay cause its theyre very dated stick to the script and what im gonna do for you joe is im gonna stay on side stage with a burlap bag full of tennis balls and any time you start going offscript and telling a story im gonna throw a tennis ball in your direction not at you just so you see it and you go oh shit right im not supposed to do that right right because at one point he kept repeating the story no ones ever stopped him its a story about when he was a teenager and there was another gang somewhere in delaware and that gang leader was named corn pop and he said remember the night before a gang fight how youd take that straight razor and youd put it in a rain barrel to let it get rusty all night ahah tennis ball where is the tennis ba',\n",
       "  'll what are you talking about a straight razor no i dont sound like were in the westerns where they go like that on their face and then youre saying you put it in water on purpose to get it rusty to then i guess when you stabbed people to give them tetanus like this is sociopathic no i thought trump was too old but heres where i knew he was definitely too old because whenever he gives speeches in any state that has any relationship with coal or coal mining he gets up front everybody goes you know what im gonna do im gonna open like a bazillion gillion trillion new coal mines and were gonna have coal everywhere and all the young people are gonna be so happy because they could be coal miners and they can stay in their area part of me thought you know what i think he believes that in in some way but i think you believe that because youre too old because i have met  millennials on the road and i have not yet met one that i think would agree to be a coal miner and nor should they i would give everything i have though to see their reaction to the job description of coal mining just sitting on their phones halfass paying attention to me so wait what so like you want me to go into earth in the daytime in a rollercoaster to get rocks like rocks well will my phone work down there because i wont do it if i cant tiktok thats my thing so yeah no i tried to learn to tiktok over the pandemic my nieces love it but theyre  and theyre like well show you aunt kath and they show me their phones and i watch them if youve never seen tiktok its just a barrage of videos and i put them down and theyre like you didnt like it did you i go well heres what ill say about it i feel like i just sat next to someone who did an eight ball  nope im a drinker not a drugger so nope and they go like oh are you saying its like too much i go yeah its way too much i cant i cant process it they go yeah but just because our videos are mostly dance and music and stuff like you could build your own and it wont be as crazy i said all right so i signed up and i dont know how it decides what your first batch of videos is gonna be but my first batch all of my people were in hospice i was like  this is horrible why would anybody watch this why why is this entertaining and theyre like dont watch it too long or youll get a lot more of them i was like what theyre like mmhmm too late you went past six seconds they go did you ever watch one somewhere i go okay on instagram i did i watched a hospice video maybe they know that because the girl was so young she was like  years old she was sadly dying but she had said it all started with her eye twitching and at the time my left eye had been twitching for like two and a half weeks i just know i was tired running around then i was like shit i didnt know it could end like this like this is id prefer instagram because its passive its just yeah its just oh look beagle puppy beagle oh theres a cat eating a popsicle its just pleasant theres nothing bad people are nice on instagram like twitter i like it but its aggressive you better be ready its like walking into a bar at midnight and everybodys had shots except you yeah well look what the cat dragged in with a little opinion about nothing and ive tweeted about everything and never really got any backlash except it was shocking sports who would think youd think itd be politics or nope nope nope nope just sports one day i just tweeted out because im from st louis i tweeted out go cards thats all i wrote shut your whore bitch mouth hold on hey hey hey hey that was uncalled for okay i didnt type fuck the cubs did i no i typed go cards thats all i said so i dont tweet about sports anymore facebook i dont love it i have it for work but i dont like mark zuckerberg yeah because i feel like he stole all of our information he sold it  times around the globe to sunday and he never really paid a price for that right  and sadly last summer we had him in front of a senate committee but the people asking the questions were so old i truly think they were just excited to meet him i do well hello there mr zuckerberg i joined the facebook on a sunday morning super happy youre here because coincidentally i forgot my password it used to be  then the wife said that was too easy and i changed it but i dont remember so i was hoping at the break you could help me retrieve the said password my parents like it but theyre  they get up in the morning they drink coffee and then they troll the entire family every second cousin third cousin people we lived by when i was five thats their morning entertainment thats what i told my teenage nieces and nephews im like uh heads up if i were you guys i would not friend grandpa or grandma for that matter they look innocent and they seem nice but theyre spies thats what they are theyre flatout spies theyre gonna go through your whole feed and theyre gonna read everything and then theyre gonna tell your parents who are too busy for that shit and report back well one nephew goes well i already friended grandpa i go well i would unfriend grandpa and he goes well i think it would hurt his feelings i said well if he were to notice which he will not just tell him it broke there will be no further questions because theyll accept that huh all right it broke both of our both of our parents just turned  and i go you know what youre the age youre the exact age as a matter of fact of people that are running this country i said honestly do you think you could be the president and my dad goes uh do you mean individually i said as compared to what he goes as a couple could we do it as a couple i go what well you know like some days ',\n",
       "  'i dont remember anything but your mom will remember all kinds of stuff its weird and in other days she wont remember shit and im like i got you i got it together were probably about  he said but individually christ no kathleen we cant i dont even know where the car is at i think the cutoff should be  or  thats fair enough right if you have to be a minimum age there should be a maximum age like it because ive seen the difference in my parents between say  and  like  everything was pretty much all right id say eighty oh now whenever i see them theyre completely covered in band aids im like wow what are you guys doing are you like stabbing each other with pencils for fun my dads like no no no its the medication we take kathleen youre barely banging or something theres blood shooting everywhere its a problem its a problem we cant even go to your sisters house because of that cat well bleed out over there we will bleed out he goes look at these scratch marks these are three weeks old kathleen they we dont heal anymore either thats a new thing we dont heal and i looked and i go oh my god let me go get the new skin it wont work we tried it heres the problem with new skin it turns out your skin you have to have enough skin to connect with that other skin and were running out of skin i dont know what comes after this  at  theres so many health problems that like nothings alarming anymore its like oh okay i called they were in florida and i said hey what are you guys doing my mom goes well were going to the hospital because your dad thinks he might be having another heart attack i said oh shit i go well let me talk to him she goes well no hes driving  i go seriously mom i know its crazy kathleen but he said if i drive he sure will have a heart attack and right now it could be indigestion we ate spicy food last night i dont love calling there cause he has his hearing aids and if you call somebody with hearing aids on his cell phone this is all youre probably gonna hear on your end eeeeeee and they dont hear you going hello they dont hear it because the stupidest system ive ever heard of the hearing aid company decided that when a hearing aid battery is going even slightly low they decided the good idea would be to have the hearing aid make a noise to alert the hardofhearing person which they dont hear everyone else hears it dogs in the neighborhood are going all  whats that  like what a dumbass system like when the hearing aid is about to go dead that thing should start vibrating in his ear and then fly around the house like that ball in harry potter till he grabs it out of the air and then when they get older theres less to talk about because they do less you know so when i call thats fine but like they golf they like to golf so if i ask my dad how was golf oh  answer i dont know if thats a dude thing he will go through every hole every club every putt how he was in the woods versus my mom nope mom how was golf i saw a fox yes thank you thats what im looking for short concise interesting animalbased jesus christ she has an iphone because i bought it and i sincerely wish i hadnt because now every time it breaks she calls me shes like kathleen that iphone you bought me broke again so i took it to walmart random we didnt buy it at walmart but whatever mom youre  take all your broken shit into walmart just throw it on the ground start crying maybe somebody will fix it maybe youll be arrested whatever you got to nothing else going on do it she said no they wont they wont help you i went back to that phone counter and there was a young guy working there and he asked me a question i answered it and then he started laughing and then another kid came out i asked the same question and this went on through three people kathleen i said well what was the question she said well he kept saying who is your provider and i kept saying my daughter  no i am not im not your provider but im like your your supplier like a drug deal i gave you the supply she goes well whos our provider as of right now i said our provider is sprint because we dont care about service sprint is so shilly but i dont care because some days i dont like getting calls you know let the lord decide whos getting through ill im involved in a cricket match in mumbai i dont have that kind of time sprint is so strange though i think ive i think i stay because im curious because like it doesnt work in places where it should work like here or chicago you know cities like it doesnt really work but then out of nowhere itll work in some random ass place thats why i like if youre gonna go out drinking and you think things might get crazy and maybe go off the rails you should make sure somebody in your group has sprint because like if we got completely shitfaced tonight and ended up in one of el chapos tunnels and people were like oh my god well how can we get out our phones wont work oh yeah bitches whos got four bars sprint does thats right  its never even truly bothered me except one time i flew to south dakota and my plan was im gonna get off the plane and uber to this casino deal well when i landed my phone was just going  like a tornado warning or something crazy and then it started blinking ive never seen anything happen before like that you are now internationally roaming oh sprint im in south dakota theres another one on top of it im not even near a border you morons but then i was curious to see if they had uber and theres nobody in the airport its small its pretty much empty but theres an old lady in a card table that just says information and shes doing the crossword puzzle and i walked out but i was very respectful and pol',\n",
       "  'ite i go excuse me maam i was just curious do you guys have uber here shed never stop doing the crossword puzzle she goes i dont know anyone by the name of uber but if you need a ride i can have darryl come get you no cause when she said get i heard take im like no im not getting in the car with darryl so then i thought well ill just rent a car the phone aint working anyway and i rent from avis and i love avis and heres why cause if you rent a lot of times from avis you get in their frequent renter club and their frequent renter club is the wizard club so you become a wizard right and they send you a card in the mail like mine said wizard madigan and i you would not think that that would excite me at this age but it was so awesome i was so excited and then the greatest part is like if youre in a bigger city where they have the shuttle when the avis shuttle pulls up a fullgrown adult has to look at me another fullgrown adult and without laughing say are you a wizard  god damn right im a wizard come on just once before i quit the road i wanna get dressed up from head to toe as a wizard and i dont wanna wait at the avis shuttle spot and i i dont wanna have luggage or nothing i wanna have one of those scepter sticks with the ball on the end and then when the driver pulls up he goes are you a wizard i wanna go ahh cause at best im a crazy lady at worst im a real wizard and i just did something horrible my parents go to florida in the winter cause its warmer than missouri thats where im from the state of missouri oh that was such a smattering polite applause i know people dont know how to react its okay its in the middle at least you guys have an idea of where its at in colorado but like the coast no i was in california its a bar the girl says im gonna need to see your license i gave it to her she goes missouri is that by minnesota i said it is in the  we moved all the ms together so they could be in the middle for the m you know like we moved montana over and then that kicked iowa even further by the is like illinois and indiana and she just went oh and walked away i went oh my god i think she believed me thats not true dont tell your friends that that is not true i grew up in st louis and i grew up a lot in the ozarks and lately there have been a lot of shows about the ozarks and my mom is so upset shes like have you seen these shows about the ozarks cause they live their fulltime in florida and shes like i just find it awful theyre making us look like hillbillies and kathleen we have a panera now  its getting more modern but that hillbilly thing is still definitely there last christmas eve me and my brother i said before we go back to mom and dads lets just stop and get a beer and we went to some back ass ozark hillbilly bar and we walked in were the only two people great but a guy comes in and missouri is an opencarry state that used to mean liquor now it just means any weapon you can find on the internet like a cannon bring it fuck it nobody cares bow and arrow youre good no problem guns it doesnt matter its just a free for all but this guy walked in with a gun on each hip and he sat down on the barstool and he ordered three bud lights and three shots of fireball yeah hes alone right so hes here im here my brothers here so i moved from this bar stool around to this side putting my brother in the line of fire in the event that hillbilly hell decides to shoot a gun tonight for fun or some shit but i knew hed see me do it and i knew it might cost a thing and he looked at me and he goes you scared of this and i knew he meant the guns well i go no im not scared of bud light thats crazy talk i said im not scared of your fireball either i love fireball every now and then and im not even scared of your guns but altogether  i find it a little concerning and then he said so you dont believe in the second amendment well now before you answer that question you have to think about it cause its gonna deem how the rest of your nights gonna go and i had already ordered nachos right  so i said i will only discuss the second amendment if you could name another amendment    and thats when my brother got mad at me hes like goddammit can you ever just keep your mouth shut kathleen we were having a nice time is this where you wanna die is it you wanna die at the drunken catfish cause this is whats gonna happen when you mouth off off like that i said patrick youre getting way too upset he didnt even understand my joke like some jokes are just for me he shot his fireball and smiled were good everything is good everything is fine  it gets too cold for my mom and dad there though it doesnt get as cold as when i was a kid i mean somethings happening i dont know what with the weather but like when i was in fifth grade that year we had  snow days yup  and we never made them up  nope the nun said fuck it school is over on may  and dont even think about bringing those little rat bastards back around here because this convents got a float trip down the merrimack scheduled and were going  thats why like when my friends with grade school kids or my younger siblings that have grade school kids during covid when it was an online homeschooling they were all just unraveling one phone call was worse than the next this is ridiculous i dont even know how to do sixth grade math anymore science i never understood to begin with im drinking margaritas at  in the morning so i dont kill people in this house  at one point i told my younger sister i go just dont do it she goes what i go just dont do it it doesnt matter i missed  days of fifth grade and so far in my life its never come up  ive never been in a bar ',\n",
       "  'where somebody said something and i was the only one shocked like what we had a civil war shut up i never heard about that maybe  my parents like florida i dont really totally get it they leave the day after christmas and then they come back on easter like jesus they rise from the state of florida back to my brothers backyard in missouri they just reappear im like wow youre back and theres still two of you well done i dont know what youre doing down there but you look wonderful there theres a lot of drinking going on down there with the old people in the retirement places like my mom goes i want you to go to my golf league and meet my friends i said okay what time do we teeoff  but i like to get there at  what i said no mom  ill go all right fine so we go at  i meet all of her friends i get in the golf cart at  am i go mom your friends are a lot of fun but what exactly is wrong with that lady marybeth she goes oh well shes hammered  i said dear mom it is  in the morning she goes well we dont have a relationship with time anymore kathleen we dont really live within time were like out of time were in a different dimension than you people that are in real time she goes you know i mean some days we wake up at  some days  i mean today ive already had lasagna  oh my god ill tell you what though if you ever think you have a drinking problem go down to florida and hang out with those old people cause they will do stuff for you like whoa hey jameson and toast like ive never even thought about that im fine like im fine  i never truly have ever thought i had a drinking problem till about three years ago i was in nash i flew in nashville and i rented a car and my friend goes oh people are coming over can you stop and get some wine i said sure i dont know the liquor laws in every state so i go into a grocery store and i get a bottle of red a bottle of white sat them down the lady looks at me with complete disdain and she goes maam those are not for sale i said well i dont wanna freak anybody out but theres a whole aisle of them  and they have price tags on them that front door is open and that cash register is on so to somebody who aint from around here this whole situation implies that a sales going down and she said and i quote maam tennessee is a christian state now i didnt say nothing right there cause i still wanted the wine i thought i was in the game right i just let that one go its hard but i let it go she goes and you are not allowed to buy wine on sundays now i might have been okay if she just stopped there but she kept going she goes but you can buy beer what i go can i ask you something and im not im not from here im not trying to be sarcastic and she goes you may i said well im not from here and im catholic so i dont really know anything about the bible but  too vague too long sorry i dont have the time but i do think i remember a story from the bible about jesus turning water into wine and i dont think i have ever heard a story about jesus turning water into beer so maybe you can explain to me why the christians in the state of tennessee will make jesus a beer guy when clearly he was a wine guy like thats documented  now theres two men behind me a guy and an older guy with overalls on and he leaves and the old guy in the overalls he says to me maam its just all about the alcohol content i go right but like if i drink  beers id be way more drunk than if i just had a glass of wine with dinner right he goes yeah youre right i didnt even know what i meant i just heard that on the tv when they were talking about it  wow im like im in a circle of stupid and i started it and now i cant get out now shes mad at him too the old lady she said were both in the penalty box and she goes i want you both to know i dont find any of this humorous  i said me neither and i left cause i got my wine and then as i was walking to the car i was getting madder and madder and then i thought wait a minute im get maybe i have a drinking problem im getting way too angry about two shitty bottles of wine but then i was like no if i had a drinking problem id have bought the beer cause a drink is a drink at some level  im on cheat day with alcohol too wine i dont care what kind boxed wine fine fine fine fine fine fine i dont know whos doing their marketing but theyre not selling their biggest selling points the two biggest selling points to me about the boxed wine first and foremost especially if you have judgey neighbors it makes no noise in the trash thats right  whatd you do all weekend nothing its super quiet  the other thing is you can always get into a box of wine ive been given bottles of wine on the road go back to the hotel shit no wine opener and then boom the cork breaks oh sad times no wine thats never gonna happen with a box of wine cause even if that sprout deal breaks off you can stab it you can stab the box youre getting in if youre determined even with a pair of tweezers you can get in there but hold them tight cause sometimes if it hits it it could slide backwards and cut your hand im not gonna tell you why i would know that but just trust me i do find some of my friends know a lot about wine but sometimes i think theyre situationally unaware like i took my friend lou to a really shitty lake dive bar in tennessee we get in and he goes so kathleen did you have a wine list  lou look behind the bar look on the wall you see what were looking at i go thats a stuffed squirrel playing a tiny banjo lou yeah its marvelous i dont even know where you find that do you google on amazon a squirrel tiny banjo i dont and then the person shellacked that and then they nailed that to driftwood and',\n",
       "  ' then they hung that as a full piece of art and you know what the guy who did that lou does not have a wine list i guarantee you that guy has a bottle of jack daniels and a carton of marlboro reds and this is his idea of art and i like it  a lot of people as they get older they just decide to quit drinking im like no im not gonna quit i do find though the older i get theres stuff i wont start that i might have when i was young you know people are its usually physical things hey do you wanna learn how to snow ski um let me google the deductibles on broken legs oh no ill be at the bar at  no i did a corporate gig in hawaii which never happens and they were such a nice group they were from minnesota this insurance company and every day the leader of the group would call my room to see if i wanted to do their activities it was always going hey kathleen thats me bob from minnesota i know bob you dont have to keep saying the minnesota part i got you because its either you or the my pillow guy calling my room and i dont know that man he goes well i just wanted to see if you wanted to join us for surf camp i said well i dont have my glasses on but i think its dark outside right now he goes yeah its dark its  but the sun comes up at  and were gonna start surf camp at dawn i thought oh i didnt say it  how fortunate for the sharks that all all of these white walleyes from minnesota are just gonna drop through their ceiling right in time for breakfast be like pizzas falling in here tonight were like oh my god look a pepperoni this is crazy  but i didnt say that because i dont wanna be rude and he goes well you know just in case you are afraid i wanna let you know now they have foam surfboards so if it does come back and hit you in the face it doesnt break all your facial bones  youre still not selling me all this bob because ill tell you this bob and i wasnt gonna bring it up but since we keep talking about it on the way over here i did think about snorkeling and i googled uh shark attacks in the water surrounding maui and in the last six years or five theres been three fatalities now that may not seem like a lot compared to the amount of people that are in the water every day but it is a lot if you were one of those three because thats it the games over thats it its over and i cant tell you how i am gonna die bob but i can tell you how im not gonna die  and unless there is a great white shark bartending at that tiki hut  its not going down like that bob  and then whats crazy if you put something like that into youtube or google shark attacks in the water oh my god seven million videos come up of horrifying things and i dont know what made me click on the one it was like a  minutes or one of those shows it was an old guy interviewing this young cute girl a surfer girl but unfortunately her right arm had been eaten off by a shark and this was to be a feelgood thing because shes gonna surf again and shes sitting there with her parents and the old guy goes so youre gonna to surf again huh are you nervous because well  so inappropriate right and the but the girl goes no because like i told my parents what are the odds of a shark eating my other arm and her parents were just sitting there i wanted to go tell her the same the exact goddamn same whats the matter with you and you know why theyre the same because sharks dont have monday morning meetings about what has occurred and what will be occurring this is tiffany somebody ate her right arm off a year and a half ago shes getting back in the water lets not eat her left arm off too okay dont be a dick bill everybody knows its you theres a lot of nice sharks in this room giving us a bad name  and ive watched shark week my whole life im not getting in ever ever again its never ever gonna happen i like shark week and i really love the show im very faithful to the show snapped on oxygen yeah its its like the only show they have anymore like if you turn on the guide on oxygen it just says snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap and if youve never seen it its about women who have tolerated a whole lot of crap in their life bad crap until one day they dont  and thats the snap and whats crazy about this show is not only are the crimes usually off the charts crazy but the women who did them theyre on the show its not actors and they seem so extraordinarily normal like any lady youd meet in the suburbs i know now nobodys normal and its the way they tell the story it sounds almost sweet when it starts hi my names sue uh yeah me and uh me and dave got married young we were young but a couple of years into the marriage i found out he was having an affair and i was just heartbroken i was so upset but he apologized and said he was drunk and i was young so i stayed fast forward a couple kids later a few more years later i find out hes having his second affair and now im angry i am im angry because we have two little kids and this is their dad and they really like him and again i chose to stay and then fast forward a few more years later i found out he was having his third affair and thats when i set him on fire  yeah i did he was just laying there on that couch passed out and i thought you know ive asked him to move the gas cans in the garage at least  times and i thought you know dammit ill move them you watch me ill do it  and this is why when my friends in their  and  they get divorced and then theyll start dating and then theyll always circle back around and go goddamn kathleen i had no idea how many women out there are crazy well you know what thats your fault because we have a whole channel devoted to what we are capable when the envelope ge',\n",
       "  'ts pushed and its you can watch it too its not just for women but thats the problem you guys arent watching it you know whos watching it other women were just getting ideas i know prison sentences i know which states have the death penalty you dont even know how much shit i know from that show and whats really alarming is my mom loves it too i would say weve probably both been watching it for seven years and ive never seen a repeat oh yeah  i like that and i still watch tiny house hunters yeah the other ones i got bored with but tiny i like it because i feel like if you have never seen it its usually a couple and i feel like theyre suffering some sort of clinical nervous breakdown but nobody in their family or friends wanna deal with that shit so everyone just encourages them yeah you should live in a tiny house you should leave right now i dont even know why youre still here like get going  the whole concept is that the tiny house is  square feet or less and theyll all want it to be mobile okay because theyre gonna tow this shit show all across north america and bother every single person theyve ever met on facebook hi do you care if we live in a yard for like a year well be so quiet but with this show whats alarming is every time they pull up the couple to get their tiny house theyre like in a  honda civic well come on guys you cant pull that with that you cant even pull another honda with that honda the tiny house you want is  the truck you need to pull that tiny house is  so why dont we take your dumbasses truck shopping and thats why i will never be the host of tiny house hunters because it would turn into truck shopping a show which i would have no interest in at all anyway because as an adult i dont think theres anything worse for me maybe aside from doing taxes is having to buy a car so much and i dont care what i drive up until last november my car was a  mercury mariner hold your applause  theres more than just me i see them out there i loved it but then it started acting weird im like shit im gonna go have to buy a car and my sister whos my height important to this story she drives a gmc acadia ive driven that im like thatll do ill just go get one of those so i called the gmc people i go im coming down there and im gonna pay cash and i dont wanna i dont wanna spend any more than an hour i dont wanna talk about math or math or math i dont wanna be in your play where you go talk to some secret person i dont i dont i dont im just gonna pay what you tell me it cost and then im going to leave it thisll probably be the last car ill ever buy for all i know okay sure come on down so i go down and dave is my guy i said dave i truly dont give a shit i dont even care what color it is all i care about dave one thing my deal breaker that seat has to go up electronically because it may not look like it dave but i am actively shrinking in real time like its a thing dave like in five years im gonna be in a car seat because for fourten or under is the law  i said other than that i dont care and he goes well you know you did say on the phone that you travel a lot so i worked up some numbers about leasing no dont do this dave and he did it he just started talking about math  la la la and at some point he noticed i had drifted out  and he goes kathleen are you still with me no dave i quit listening like eight minutes ago he goes well what are you thinking about maybe i can help you i go do you really wanna know what i was thinking about dave honest to god ill tell you what i was thinking about because maybe you can help me because um i havent figured it all out yet um i just found out that in like the next um few months im gonna have im gonna go to do shows in portland oregon eugene oregon and medford oregon and at night me and the other comedian will drive uh to get to the other city and i was thinking about what i would do if we hit a bigfoot  yeah  because think about it dave you know with covid the animals are coming into town more and theyre more comfortable and its worth millions and millions of dollars dave thats why you have to have a plan like you cant just react emotionally in the moment or youre gonna lose all your money so while you were talking i figured theres two scenarios dave scenario a is ive hit it and its injured oh not good right its stuck under the wheel well like  then how do i explain that dave and so i mean im a wizard but i only have so many powers i cant be in charge of that scenario b dave is ive hit it and its dead thats a lot more of a tame scenario so thats the one i would hope for but then you have to think dave what are you gonna do like are you gonna call the police im not because i dont trust the popo theyll steal my bigfoot i know they will its worth millions and millions of dollars am i gonna post a picture on instagram no because then the millennials will get motivated and theyll get up and theyll come out there and beat me up and steal my bigfoot because i will have forgotten to turn off my location am i gonna post it on tiktok no because most of my people are in a hospice and they dont need to be bothered with my horseshit so thats as far as i got dave i dont know what i will do yet but i know a lot of stuff i wont do and thats how you start a good plan for you he just looked at me with his eyes theyre weird and where he goes so the only thing you care about is if the seat goes up yes dave  all right you guys i got to get out of here thank you so much denver youre always the best thank you   kathleen   kathleen   bye bye up there   kathleen   kathleen   kathleen   kathleen   whats it all about   boxed wine   and tiny banjos   kathlee']]"
